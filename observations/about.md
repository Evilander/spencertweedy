## Observations is a daily blog published on a not-so-daily basis by [Spencer Tweedy](https://spencertweedy.com/).

I owe it all to the guy eating whole dill pickles out of a ziplock bag in Union Park, Chicago, July 2018.

I was working at a music festival in the park when he walked by, handlebar mustache, all-brown outfit (broutfit), pickle bag and all. There was something so exciting, so picturesque about him, I had to write it down. So I did. And then I wrote down other things about my day, and about the day after that, and after that. And I haven’t stopped since.

I had been looking for a reason to start writing on the internet again, anyway. My friend Heather Whinna bought this domain name for me in 2004, when I was about nine, and I used it to blog from ages twelve to sixteenish. (She bought it because she didn’t want it to get gobbled up by porn sites, a fate which she thought, reasonably, was likely for all un-purchased domains in 2004.) The blog was an important part of my life then; I grew up feeling connected to people (mostly Wilco fans) and heard because I had an outlet here. And it gave me lots of training in writing and web design.

But at some point, blogging started to feel weird. I’m not sure if it was the shift to social media, or if I just became a more private person, but I lost the motivation to do it (in public, at least). And it took this bullet-pointy way of writing, and the Pickle Man, to make me start again.

## Blogging Medicine

The limitations of **✻&#x2009;OBSERVATIONS** make it easier for me to write. The bullet points remind me to keep every item to its topic sentence, which I find harder to do in full paragraph form. And in an anal, analytic sort of way, they help me feel like I’m getting the full list of my ideas across, even while I recognize that the mind is an amorphous blob and there’s no such thing as the “full list” of ideas in the first place.

The unwritten prefix, “I observed…,” before every list item frees me from the rote diary-writing question of “What did I do today?” Maybe more than anything, this format of filling in the blanks (and taking notes in the moment, when something really strikes me) has helped me feel like the site is worthwhile and not just a chronological account of my day.

Finally, **✻&#x2009;OBSERVATIONS** helps me clear my mind. When I was younger and I went to summer camp, I would bring a paper notebook at first because smartphones didn’t exist, and then when they did, because we weren’t allowed to bring them. My mind felt clearer there probably for a lot of reasons (no school, no other work to think about, no internet stimulation) but it was largely because I had a single, unified receptacle for the stuff I wanted to write down. It can be unhealthy to consolidate and collect everything into one place—it can bring me back to the fallacy I mentioned above, that it’s possible to make a perfect and absolute account of all your thoughts—but there’s still something to be said about keeping a running narrative in one, trusty notebook companion at a time. I feel more oriented when I can situate new ideas there.

Writing **✻&#x2009;OBSERVATIONS** has helped me in all those ways so far, and I’m excited to keep it going. So thank you, Pickle Man. And thank you for reading.

## Colophon

Here’s some tech info about **✻&#x2009;OBSERVATIONS** in case you’re a freaking nerd like me.

**✻&#x2009;OBSERVATIONS** is a Jekyll static site, hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (via [GitHub](https://github.com/spencertweedy/spencertweedy.github.io)), secured by [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), and registered with [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/) (graduated from Heather’s original purchase on GoDaddy). I designed it in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and I develop it in [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

The text is set in [ISO by Scribble Tone](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/scribble-tone/iso). The asterisk logo is [“Connections”](https://thenounproject.com/icon/1207551/) and the list markers are a modified [“Star”](https://thenounproject.com/icon/1696194/), licensed via NounPro on The Noun Project.

I take notes for **✻&#x2009;OBSERVATIONS** in [Bear](https://bear.app/) for Mac and iOS (using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) or, sometimes, in [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) notebooks. Then I publish them using [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/). The [newsletter](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/subscribe) runs on [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/). And there’s just one cookie on the site: a stats tracker from [Quantcast](https://www.quantcast.com/). I’d like to remove even that one, but for now, the service satisfies my goal of avoiding Google Analytics.

For stats on the posts, please see the [archive page](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/archive). You can also [subscribe to the newsletter](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/subscribe) or [send me an email](mailto:spencer@penguinmail.com).

Thanks again,  
Spencer
