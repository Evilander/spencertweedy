## Observations is a daily blog published on a not-so-daily basis by [Spencer Tweedy](https://spencertweedy.com/).

In July 2018, I was working at a music festival in Union Park, Chicago, when a man eating whole dill pickles out of a ziplock bag walked by. His steez was so cool — all-brown outfit (broutfit), handlebar mustache, submarine sandwich, bag full of pickles — I felt like I had to write about him. [So I did](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/071718.html). And then I wrote about the rest of my day, and about the day after that, and after that, and I haven’t stopped since.

I had been looking for a reason to blog again. From ages twelve to sixteen, I wrote on my website and it became a really important part of my life. It connected me with supportive strangers as far away as New Zealand (many of whom were Wilco fans). But at some point, sharing so much started to feel weird. I think a combination of the shift to social media and my own growing up made writing online, diary-style, feel frivolous. It took this bullet-pointy technique, and the Pickle Man, to make me start again.
