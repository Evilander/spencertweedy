<img src="061818-1.jpg" alt="[Image 1] This is my new blog. § I’m writing it because I miss feeling connected to people through my writing the way I did when I was blogging (when I was 12-15-ish). § But also because I am writing more on paper lately and appreciating how it helps me “write first and edit later.” I don’t overthink writing as much when I’m doing it long-hand as when I’m doing it on my iPhone screen and I thought it’d be fun to bridge some of *this* stuff back over into digital media, so I can get out of my head while reaching out to others, like the old days, too. § I’m also trying to see if I can write in the twilight state that exists before sleep in a way that’s coherent and worthwhile to share. My favorite time to write has always ben right before bed, when the brain… [text continues in next image]" />

<img src="061818-2.jpg" alt="[Image 2] …starts letting thoughts get connected in weird ways and the specter of Everyone Else (or a Judging Self) is less ever-present. It’s easiest to be free and have fun and feel like a kid making art again when there’s only enough mental energy for the imagination to work. None left for analysis or meta-analysis. (I know I’m not the first person to write about/romanticize that pre-sleep state.) (Okay, so some analysis will stick around.) § I will try my hardest to be un-precious and lighthearted writing like this, but I know it will be hard. I’ve already slowed down so much thinking about how each sentence will be perceived before I write it. But I think I need to accept that some — maybe a little, maybe a lot! — of what I say will come off as self-important or narcissistic. It would be weird if it didn’t. § Lately I’ve been realizing — or re-realizing — that there is a special, “super pretension” involved with the pursuit of not being pretentious at all. It’s sort of like… [text continues in next image]" />

<img src="061818-3.jpg" alt="[Image 3] …the ultimate pretension: being *so* self-aware, and *so* conscious, that you’ve avoided arrogance altogether. It doesn’t work that way. Inevitably, we make assumptions about other people or subconsciously exaggerate our self-worth, and then we are a schmuck for thinking that our sheer mental rigor guaranteed us against making mistakes like that. Especially in my demographic. We twenty-somethings are historically prone to chronic Pretentious Fuck syndrome. And no amount of self-reflection or second-guessing can absolutely cure us of all of it. § So I think it’s more productive and more honest to keep our bullshit detectors up — to constantly tune them with what we learn about the world and to behave accordingly — bu also to avoid the false sense of security that comes from thinking we can “thoughtful” our way out of any and all judgments by others of pretension. [text continues in next image]" />

<img src="061818-4.jpg" alt="[Image 4] Like a lot of misguided decision-making processes, I think the one that tells us we can guarantee our righteousness against a hypothetical judgment of pretension is a product of discomfort with ambiguity. We don’t like not knowing stuff so we figure out ways of feeling like we know stuff. This, like the twilight art-making state, is well-documented. § I was talking about this the other day with my girlfriend, Casey. We were talking abou how a lot of anxiety stems from not knowing something, and particularly from not knowing how something will turn out. And I mentioned that something that had helped me avoid that anxiety — some of the time — was learning about pragmatic epistemology. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, American philosophers started thinking about knowledge not in terms of absolute certainty… [text continues in next image]" />

<img src="061818-5.jpg" alt="[Image 5] …but instead in terms of reasonable certainty. They shifted the goal post of knowledge from “freedom from all *possible* doubt” to “freedom from all *reasonable* doubt.” So, we’re allowed to start *believing* stuff again, even if we’re not really *sure* of anything. We can trust our working theories. § I had one professor who demonstrated this idea to our class by talking about the floorboards in the room we were sitting in. He said he trusted they would support him when he walked into the room, even if he didn’t *know* it as a fact. We make all kinds of judgments like that every day, without even really thinking of them. If we can be so courteous to the floorboards, I think we can be courteous, too, to other further-off, more abstract things in our lives. [text continues in next image]" />

<img src="061818-6.jpg" alt="[Image 6] If I didn’t succeed in proving (proving?!) my “we will be pretentious even if, and perhaps even because, we vigorously avoid pretension” point before, I think I proved it there. But… that’s okay… § *** § There’s one more reason I decided to start this “blog” tonight. I’ve been reading the Anthony Bourdain autobiography, *Kitchen Confidential*. Prior to his death a few weeks ago, I had always written him off as a macho celebrity chef. I had no idea he was a writer and a respectful traveler and an apparently sensitive, smart person until people started sharing snippets of his writing on Twitter. The first one I saw was about his egalitarian view on cheap food from other countries. He didn’t just value high-minded food; he liked People’s food, too. And unlike Guy Fieri’s, his appreciation of local food wasn’t about kitsch (or voyeurism). It was about sincere, respectful curiosity. [page break] § I started reading the book over the weekend and it’s as funny, well-written, and interesting as I expected it to be. I’m invested in it because he’s a great storyteller, and because I’m shocked he killed himself. (Like a lot of songwriters, his writing gives you the sense that you know him, even more so than a typical autobiography does, because there’s a low-brow, rock-music mentality to him.) But I’m also invested because I started caring about food recently. § (Shifting from Bourdain to myself.) I had always thought of “culinary arts” as a shitty art form, not only because the product of all your work gets destroyed after you make it, but also because it’s filled with such exclusionism [sic] and traditionalism and haughtiness and, again, pretension. Maybe most importantly, the art is filled with things that disgust me. I was a Velveeta® mac-and-cheese eater growing up. My favorite meal was (and maybe is…) a Kid’s Cuisine. I only very recently started… [text continues in next image]" />

<img src="061818-7.jpg" alt="[Image 7] …being able to eat “adultish” food items like mushrooms and seaweed. § Here’s an aside about a recent moment where I *couldn’t* stomach adultish food items, though. A very very generous and very lovely/fun/sweet family friend recently took my mom, a friend of ours, and me out to dinner at Alinea. Alinea is a Michelin-star restaurant. It’s been named the best restaurant in Chicago a bunch of years in a row and it’s on every foodie’s list. The food was **AMAZING** and I surprised myself by eating all of every course (there are a bajillion small courses) and *liking* them. Until the umami cracker. It would have been delicious on its own. But in the context of the bajillion-course meal, it was just too much. Plus, it was a 180º turn from the creamy/fruity courses that came before it. I started having a pre-panic attack thinking that I might throw up. I had to interrupt our conversation to tell my mom about my panic, who soaked her napkin in water and put it on… [page break] § …my forehead. (Sometimes just telling someone about your panic is enough to avoid it growing into a full-blown attack.) Our other friend whom we had brought wasn’t as lucky. Thew threw up in the bathroom. At Alinea. From sheer flavor overload. § Anyway, whether it was an expanding palate or a frugal interest in relying less on restaurants, I’ve started to like food a lot more lately and I don’t think cooking is a dumb art form anymore (although Bourdain thinks it’s a *craft*). ‘Every’ artist dreams of making work that’s functional — justified by its *use* — and what’s more functional than a life-giving substance? And ‘every’ artist grapples with posterity and about the life of their work beyond their own. Chefs don’t have to worry about that (at least not in the same way). Everything they make is immediately destroyed before they have a chance to worry about how far it will reach. It goes exactly as far as the fork. There must be something very liberating about that.

<img src="061818-8.jpg" alt="[Image 8] I don’t want to be a chef but I do want to cook more. And Bourdain’s book is teaching me about that. It’s also teaching me how to relax a little, tolerate some discord (now more than ever…), and not to think I can escape the stupidity and idealism of young adulthood. There’s nothing wrong with trying to be Better or Older, as long as I remember I’m not there yet. § P.S. Sammy and I cooked our first EDIBLE dinner together tonight: pan-fried garlic-rubbed tofu, with roasted carrots/broccoli and shishito peppers. We have profound gas, but we’re proud of it." />
