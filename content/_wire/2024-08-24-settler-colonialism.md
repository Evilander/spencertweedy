I think there are at least three nasty fallacies of logic in this essay, but this resonates anyway:

> Although Israel fails in obvious ways to fit the model of settler colonialism[^1], it has become the standard reference point because it offers theorists and activists something that the United States does not: a plausible target. It is hard to imagine America or Canada being truly decolonized, with the descendants of the original settlers returning to the countries from which they came and Native peoples reclaiming the land. But armed struggle against Israel has been ongoing since it was founded, and Hamas and its allies still hope to abolish the Jewish state “between the river and the sea.” In the contemporary world, only in Israel can the fight against settler colonialism move from theory to practice.

Many American Jews have observed this tendency for ten months if not longer.

It feels as though some of our peers afford grace to white Americans for having been born on blood-soaked land, but they don’t afford that to ordinary Israeli people. By thinking that Jews should simply leave Israel, or that Hamas and Hezbollah should succeed in their [current and repeated vows](~https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/07/29/will-hezbollah-and-israel-go-to-war~) to expel Jews, some Americans prescribe a remedy for colonialism that they wouldn’t adhere to themselves, or that they wouldn’t prescribe to their next-door neighbor.

It gives the impression that Israel and Palestine are a far-away sandbox in which Americans’ aspirations for justice or revenge can be embodied. It gives the impression that the lives of distant Jews are expendable or imaginary, just as so many members of my own Jewish community think that Palestinian lives are expendable or imaginary—a ghoulish way of thinking that has cost tens of thousands of lives.

The disconnect and irresponsibility of the “Jews should just leave” perspective is disturbing in light of the fact, also, that any Jew, regardless of whether their skin is white, brown, or black, has greater [ethnic and cultural ties](~https://muse.jhu.edu/article/548065~) to the land in question than European Americans have to Turtle Island.

The desire to remedy colonialism is good. And the need to stop Israel’s conquest of Gaza and the West Bank is extremely dire. In our efforts to those ends we shouldn’t ask distant populations to undertake sacrifices we wouldn’t make ourselves. And we shouldn’t play into the hands of people who believe in the exclusive, divine rule of the Levant—whether by Arabs or by Jews. We should spend our precious energy building democracies under the noses of those rulers.

For the record, some founding Zionists considered Jewish repatriation to be a colonial project and used colonial terms (and racism) to woo European patrons and politicians. And there is no shortage of present-day extremists who would be happy to see a colonial-scale decimation of Palestinians.</span>
