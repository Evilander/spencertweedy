I think there are at least three nasty fallacies in this essay, but this resonates anyway:

> Although Israel fails in obvious ways to fit the model of settler colonialism\*, it has become the standard reference point because it offers theorists and activists something that the United States does not: a plausible target. It is hard to imagine America or Canada being truly decolonized, with the descendants of the original settlers returning to the countries from which they came and Native peoples reclaiming the land. But armed struggle against Israel has been ongoing since it was founded, and Hamas and its allies still hope to abolish the Jewish state “between the river and the sea.” In the contemporary world, only in Israel can the fight against settler colonialism move from theory to practice.

Many American Jews have been observing this phenomenon for ten months if not longer. For some of our peers, Israel and Palestine are a far-away sandbox in which our aspirations for justice (or revenge) can be embodied. We afford ourselves grace for having been born on blood-soaked land in America, but we don’t afford that to ordinary Israeli people—to say nothing of the reasons their ancestors or ours end up in such contested places in the first place.

\*For the record, some founding Zionists considered Jewish repatriation to be a colonial project and used colonial terms (and racism) to woo European patrons and politicians. And there is no shortage of present-day extremists who would be happy to see a colonial-scale decimation of Palestinians.
