> You're supposed to be really humble, where you don't have a "favorite time" that someone is going through a tragedy. Unfortunately, I'm arrogant. I think I'm the shit! So absolute shit shows are my favorite calls. Absolute shit shows! If I get to the scene of a shooting, and there's six people shot, and everyone's panicking and running—that's my favorite call. Because I perform best at that. My least favorite is when you have to comfort the family, when someone doesn't make it.
