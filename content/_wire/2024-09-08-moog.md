On tour in Asheville in the spring, I saw the “Brasstown Banger,” a rudimentary early synthesizer that Bob Moog (and collaborators?) made, at the Moog Museum. It was inspiring as hell, to see the totally chaotic, handmade beginnings of a company that ended up mass-producing (still by hand!) such gorgeous products. No photos of the instrument seem to exist online.
