Helloooo Observers,

It’s *Yankee Hotel Foxtrot* 20th anniversary week. Wilco is [livestreaming](http://nugs.net/wilcolivestream) their show from the Auditorium in Chicago on Saturday. And the fortuitously named Foxtrot Market has [special Wilco stuff](https://pages.foxtrotco.com/foxtrotxwilco/) (including Wilc-os cereal!) now until May 1. Wilco also announced a [humongous deluxe reissue](https://wilco-reissue-store.com/) of the album and performed “[Poor Places](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSAI7HWkuzU)” on Colbert. Yum!

Actually, that reissue deserves at least another sentence. The art is bonkie. The variations of the original Marina Towers cover that Lawrence Azerrad and my dad designed together add even more meaning, convey even more of the “good old future” notion that they sought to convey in 2001. And that’s to say nothing of the expertly curated outtakes and alternate versions on the discs, which help explain how the album came to be. (I’m a fan of the conversation between my dad, Glenn, Jim O’Rourke, and archivist Cheryl Pawelski, and the essay by Bob Mehr, included in some of the reissue packages too.)

I got to see three of the anniversary shows in New York and I was in a state of tears or near-tears the whole time. What they’re doing is so beautiful, not only because of its relation to the twenty-year-old album we love but also because the music is beautiful *now*, with present-day Wilco performing it. (And, in New York, the tears were kicked into overdrive by [Aizuri Quartet](https://www.aizuriquartet.com/). I’m so looking forward to hearing the strings in Chicago.) I’m glad that this milestone for the record is being marked with such thoughtful, fun fanfare.

In Spoon news (as in Spooncer, me, not the band Spoon!) I’m opening Spoon’s General Store next week, an online experimental shop full of art and home goods created by my friends. If that sounds interesting to you, [sign up](https://spoonsgeneralstore.com/) to hear when it’s live.

And now, my favorite Observations posts from the past three months. I’m delinquent with these, as per usj. I’ll spare us the pontificating. Here we go!

Thank you,  
Spencer

## On Tour with Liam Kazar

* The ultra-kind proprietor of Cafe Yaya in Austin, who, after asking about the name of our band, ran out to the van as we were leaving, blasting “[Shoes Too Tight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM0GGlcSG28)” from his phone, telling us he likes the music. <span>3-16</span>{: .date-code}
