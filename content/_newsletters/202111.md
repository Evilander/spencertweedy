Hellur Observers,

I’m [Spencer]({{ site.url }}), this is the [Observations]({{ site.url}}/observations) newsletter, and here are my picks from the blog from October.

By the way, [tickets for my dad’s solo + band shows](https://wilcoworld.net/shows/) in December and January are on sale. And so is my book about musicians with home/backyard/DIY studios, [Mirror Sound](https://mirrorsoundbook.com/), which I believe makes a good gift for loved ones who are into music, recording, or creative spaces. I feel out of character peddling the book that much, but after hearing about the empowering/liberating effect it’s had for some people, I feel more confident letting you know that it could be a helpful thing for someone in your life! [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/books/mirror-sound-the-people-and-processes-behind-self-recorded-music/9783791386539) is a great place to buy it.

Thanks for being here. I hope the seasonal change is giving you feeling-fuel, not making you miserable. Please be safe and well!

Spencer
