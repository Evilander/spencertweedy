Hi Observer Valentines.

I hope this newsletter finds you warm, well, and ensconced. Whether that’s ensconced in love, ensconced in blankets, ensconced in scones… As long as it’s a comfy ensconscement, I wish it upon you.

Here are the highlights from January’s [OBSERVATIONS](https://spencertweedy.com/observations).

***

## To the U.P.

* Kitch-iti-kipi spring. [1-12]({% link _observations/20210112.md %}){: .date-code}
	* The crystal-clear, still turquoise water.
	* The sharp fallen trees in the water’s rim, like pirate ship bowsprits.
	* The huge, prehistoric-looking trout in the basin’s depths.
	* The sand swirling around the bottom of the spring.
* The volcano mouth-esque ring of ice around the bottom of a waterfall, built up over the course of winter, one droplet freezing atop another. [1-13]({% link _observations/20210113.md %}){: .date-code}
* The rocks suspended in ice at the lakeshore, as if the waves picked them up and froze in place. [1-14]({% link _observations/20210114.md %}){: .date-code}
* Stars seen through the little rectangular window in our rented cabin bedroom. [1-13]({% link _observations/20210113.md %}){: .date-code}
* Casey and me replacing lightbulbs in the cabin with warmer ones, because we’re Like That. [1-10]({% link _observations/20210110.md %}){: .date-code}
- Walking on a frozen lake with Casey while I carried Basil in a doggie backpack. [1-10]({% link _observations/20210110.md %}){: .date-code}

***

* At 6AM: Basil peeing outside with light fluffy snow falling all around him. Angelic. [1-3]({% link _observations/20210103.md %}){: .date-code}
- Accidentally staying up long enough to watch the sun rise, and then to watch Trump leave, flying off into the clouds — grotesquely, relievingly, finally — to “My Way” by Frank Sinatra. [1-20]({% link _observations/20210120.md %}){: .date-code}
- My neighbor’s advice to me about our newly purchased table saw: “Never lose your fear of it.” [1-27]({% link _observations/20210127.md %}){: .date-code}

- [Love Is The King](https://jefftweedy.bandcamp.com/album/love-is-the-king) sitting next to Harry Styles on the Billboard vinyl chart (and at number one on the indie music chart). 😱 [1-27]({% link _observations/20210127.md %}){: .date-code}

***

* The massive TV playing a Spanish-language game show in the closed, otherwise dark *panadería*. [1-16]({% link _observations/20210116.md %}){: .date-code}
* The diehard forum users who, fifteen years into the reign of social media, still visit their favorite e-bulletin homes every day. Respect. [1-17]({% link _observations/20210117.md %}){: .date-code}

- Buying $1,000 of flooring glue. [1-26]({% link _observations/20210126.md %}){: .date-code}
* Taking my pumpkin pie fate into my own hands — finally eating some after a holiday season without any. [1-10]({% link _observations/20210110.md %}){: .date-code}

***

- The electricians who, in response to each of my questions, seemed only to grow in their dull, effortless hatred for my existence. [1-25]({% link _observations/20210125.md %}){: .date-code}

* Digging my car out of the snow with my bebooted feet. [1-31]({% link _observations/20210131.md %}){: .date-code}
* Mom, spontaneously: “I love the word pizazz.” [1-18]({% link _observations/20210118.md %}){: .date-code}

[Tell a friend about OBSERVATIONS &rarr;](mailto:?subject=A newsletter&body=I think you’d like this newsletter. This kid in Chicago blogs about every time he sees a latex glove on the ground. No, I swear it‘s better than that. No, he didn’t blog about every glove he saw in 2020 because there were too many of them. But he posts these little snippets every day and emails them once a month. I know you’re “newsletter-ed out.” This is a short one. Trust me!%0A%0Ahttps://spencertweedy.com/observations/)
