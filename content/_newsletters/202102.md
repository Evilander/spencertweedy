Hi Observer Valentines.

I hope this newsletter finds you warm, well, and ensconced. Whether that’s ensconced in love, ensconced in blankets, ensconced in scones… As long as it’s a comfy ensconscement, I wish it upon you.

Here are the highlights from January’s [OBSERVATIONS](https://spencertweedy.com/observations).

***

## To the U.P.

* Kitch-iti-kipi spring.
	* The crystal-clear, still turquoise water.
	* The sharp fallen trees in the water’s rim, like pirate ship bowsprits.
	* The huge, prehistoric-looking trout in the basin’s depths.
	* The sand swirling around the bottom of the spring.
* The volcano mouth-esque ring of ice around the bottom of a waterfall, built up over the course of winter, one droplet freezing atop another.
* The rocks suspended in ice at the lakeshore, as if the waves picked them up and froze in place.
* Stars seen through the little rectangular window in our rented cabin bedroom.
* Casey and me replacing lightbulbs in the cabin with warmer ones, because we’re Like That.
- Walking on a frozen lake with Casey while I carried Basil in a doggie backpack.

***

* At 6AM: Basil peeing outside with light fluffy snow falling all around him. Angelic.
- Accidentally staying up long enough to watch the sun rise, and then to watch Trump leave, flying off into the clouds — grotesquely, relievingly, finally — to “My Way” by Frank Sinatra.
- My neighbor’s advice to me about our newly purchased table saw: “Never lose your fear of it.”

- A delicious meal from Liam’s new food project, [Isfahan](https://www.eatisfahan.com/).
- The little actor monkeys in Charlie Chaplin’s *The Circus*.
- [Love Is The King](https://jefftweedy.bandcamp.com/album/love-is-the-king) sitting next to Harry Styles on the Billboard vinyl chart (and at number one on the indie music chart). 😱

***

* The meticulous phonetic accuracy of Jar Jar Binks’s subtitles in the *Star Wars* prequels.
* The massive TV playing a Spanish-language game show in the closed, otherwise dark *panadería*.
* The diehard forum users who, fifteen years into the reign of social media, still visit their favorite e-bulletin homes every day. Respect.

***

- Paying my union dues.
- Buying $1,000 of flooring glue.
* Taking my pumpkin pie fate into my own hands — finally eating some after a holiday season without any.

***

- The electricians who, in response to each of my questions, seemed only to grow in their dull, effortless hatred for my existence.
* The neighbor cross-country skiing in the falling snow.
* The thrill of reading “Wilco” in Bob Dylan’s *Chronicles*.

***

* The high-pitched patter of rain falling on ice.
* Digging my car out of the snow with my bebooted feet.
* Mom, spontaneously: “I love the word pizazz.”

And Happy Valentine's Day! 💘

[Tell a friend about OBSERVATIONS &rarr;](mailto:?subject=A newsletter&body=I think you’d like this newsletter. This kid in Chicago blogs about every time he sees a latex glove on the ground. No, I swear it‘s better than that. No, he didn’t blog about every glove he saw in 2020 because there were too many of them. But he posts these little snippets every day and emails them once a month. I know you’re “newsletter-ed out.” This is a short one. Trust me!%0A%0Ahttps://spencertweedy.com/observations/)
