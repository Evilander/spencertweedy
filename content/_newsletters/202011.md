Hi Observers,

I’ve got a double edition for you this month: October and November combined. But before we start, can I ask you a question? Does this format work for you? Is monthly OK or would you like something more/less frequent? I continue to struggle to send this newsletter out on time, partly because I can’t convince myself it DESERVES precious space in your inbox, but also because I think there might be better, cooler things to do with this medium. (Something that makes use of my [printed receipts](https://www.instagram.com/observationsinc/) maybe?) You’re always generous to assure me the newsletter is worthwhile. But it still feels like there’s room to improve! So please let me know if you have any thoughts on frequency, content, whatever.

(Here’s what’s really going on: I’m in love with Noah Kalina’s [weekly newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/6068da7c609b/noahkalina) and it inspires me to reach for greater email-based heights. Though let it be known that we chose monospace fonts independently of each other. I defend my and others’ font originality with vigor and pettiness.)

Thanks for bein’ here. Now, the September and October selects. I sincerely hope you’re well and safe!

Spencer
