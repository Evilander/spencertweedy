Hello Observers, from rainy Massachusetts, where we’re (Dad, Liam and me) playing two shows at MASS MoCA in honor of museum director Joe Thompson’s retirement. It’s strange but fun to be here in North Adams in a non-Solid Sound year — like being at home with none of your furniture in it. Maybe? Luckily, Solid Sound 2022 dates were just [announced](https://solidsoundfestival.com/).

Here’s July’s OBSERVATIONS roundup. As always, the full month of posts is on the [blog](https://spencertweedy.com/observations). These are my fave. Thanks for reading!
