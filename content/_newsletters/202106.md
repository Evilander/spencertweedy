Hi Observers,

Here’s a big one for ya. Four months of backed-up highlights, cherry picked by me on this alternately sunny and thunderstormy Chicago day (yesterday). I say “big” but it’s the usual 1,000 words, just spanning two seasons and about a gazillion states.

(If you’ve forgotten, this is [Observations](https://spencertweedy.com/observations), a newsletter by me, Spencer Tweedy. If you no longer want to subscribe, no worries — <unsubscribe>unsubscribe here</unsubscribe>.)

Here we go! Thanks for reading.
