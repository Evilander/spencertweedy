Hi Observers —

Coming to you from sunny/rainy Mexico, here are last month’s highlights!

***

# Observations

* The chickens in the trees near my aunt Debbie’s house. <span>12-2</span>{: .date-code}
* The peacocks in the streets. <span>12-2</span>{: .date-code}
* The [Musical Instrument Museum](https://mim.org/) in Phoenix with Aunt Debbie and Casey. Six hours of wide-eyed, wide-eared experience. So fun. <span>12-3</span>{: .date-code}
	* The countless folk instruments from hundreds of cultures around the world, often displayed alongside video footage of musicians from that culture playing the very same instrument.
	* The painstaking detail of a *tonbak* drum made out of thousands of tiny pieces of wood and bone.
	* The massive, carved slot drums.
	* The teeny, funnily shaped proto-violins.
	* The sensation of hitting a reproduction *pow wow* drum in the museum’s “experience center.” It’s so wide, and its sound is so low, it really makes you feel something.
	* The model of a Zen Buddhist flutist wearing a *tengai* (basket hat) [pictured above].
	* Overhearing someone ask if a photo of Steve Vai was Neil Young.
	* Doug Clifford’s (of CCR) Camco drums. Hal Blaine’s cymbals. Parts of the “Pictures of Lily” kit The Who [exploded](https://youtu.be/TZkjA8DTg4o?t=309) on Smothers Brothers!
	* The woman playing a shaker in the gift shop saying, proudly, to an employee, “I like noise.”
* The slanted ceilings; geodesic-looking armchairs; short, wide tables; and overall coziness of Frank Lloyd Wright’s [Taliesin West](https://franklloydwright.org/taliesin-west/). <span>12-5</span>{: .date-code}
	* Feeling surprised, a little revolted, and a lot encouraged by the imperfection of the campus’s construction. Beams that don’t tightly fit into their supports, badly hung doors, exposed electrical wire nuts. Of course it didn’t detract from the wonderfulness of the place. According to the guide, much of the campus was built by his architecture students.
* Cleaning years of corrosive gunk off an electrical box. <span>12-9</span>{: .date-code}
* The dryer exhaust blowing out billowing steam into the courtyard. <span>12-10</span>{: .date-code}
* The cluster of faint, small stars that look like blackheads. <span>12-11</span>{: .date-code}
* The separate, independently made, equally “concerned” comments my family members have made about the landmark pimple on my cheek.
* Getting a PCR test at a bizarre, empty, Catholic clinic in an office-y medical building, from a nurse who, moments prior, had been the maskless receptionist, and who forgot to ask for my contact information after collecting my nose sample. Was it an illegal DNA harvesting operation?!? <span>12-17</span>{: .date-code}
* “[If You Ever Find Yourself](https://audacity.substack.com/p/if-you-ever-find-yourself)” by Erika J. Simpson. How, sometimes, reading stories about people who overcome systemic injustice with love can make me momentarily complacent. Like, “Wow, the problems that caused Erika’s suffering are so deep and so pervasive, but I guess I don’t have to do anything about them because she had love and she ended up OK.” But that’s not how it works. Just because Erika made the best of things and found support doesn’t mean that the systems that were stacked against her are tolerable. <span>12-22</span>{: .date-code}
* At a rural gas station, around dinner time on Christmas Eve, a young, gruff-looking dad waiting to drop his daughter off with her mom. <span>12-24</span>{: .date-code}
* Neil Young talking about building train diorama mountain ranges out of live wood and moss on [Broken Record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IRroVvvo4g). <span>12-24</span>{: .date-code}
* Christmas Day with Casey and her family :) <span>12-25</span>{: .date-code}
* Melting my mind listening to cymbal samples on [MyCymbal](https://memphisdrumshop.com/cymbals). <span>12-28</span>{: .date-code}
* Watching *[Crock of Gold](https://www.crockofgoldfilm.com/)* with Dad and Sammy, growing to love Shane MacGowan. Also, nearly crying at the intensity and earnestness of Irish traditional music and the early Pogues footage. <span>12-29</span>{: .date-code}

***

And a lil exhortation…
* If you must put something down on your car while you’re doing another task, at least put it on your hood where you’ll see it before you start driving again. If we as a human community have learned *anything* from *[Raising Arizona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouXz_ETh2eI)*. <span>12-10</span>{: .date-code}
