Hi Observers,

It’s the last edition of the year! Thank you for following along with this project in 2021. Next year, I plan to publish the much-delayed Year Two chapbook and more [receipts](https://www.instagram.com/observationsinc/). I might also rename this newsletter to a generic “Spencer Tweedy’s Newsletter” and make Observations just one section of it. It would still be short and monthly, just with a little more room for show announcements and other thoughts. Who knows? In any case, thank you for being here, replying with your own observations and making this feel worthwhile.

I hope you’re having a safe, relaxing holiday time. And that your year ahead is wonderful.

— Spencer

* Almost getting t-boned by a red-light-running pickup truck as my car stereo blared the climax of Ornette Coleman and Pat Metheny’s “[Endangered Species](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8tzWTcutog).” <span>11-11</span>{: .date-code}
* The recently discovered [evidence](https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/first-report-of-a-new-navigational-supersense-that-birds-use-to-find-their) that some birds can sort of see the Earth’s magnetic field. <span>11-08</span>{: .date-code}

* The friend-hungry, exceedingly macho securities trader from whom Jason and I bought a bandsaw. <span>11-15</span>{: .date-code}
* Wondering, how did wooden ships of antiquity prevent water from getting in between the boards? The simple answer: shipbuilders tarred the boards or overlapped them. <span>11-21</span>{: .date-code}
* The spectrum of believing the world is full of assholes out to get you or sweethearts out to help you. <span>11-09</span>{: .date-code}
	* That where you sit on that spectrum affects how you treat others. Believe there are assholes, preemptively be an asshole. Believe there are sweethearts, be a sweetheart. Roughly speaking.
	* How, in that way, your belief is self-fulfilling, since the way *you* behave helps define the world.

* Playing with Kelly Hogan (with Nora O’Connor and Joel Paterson!), opening for Mavis Staples, at Thalia Hall. <span>11-19</span>{: .date-code}
	* Mavis was so energetic and so hilarious on stage, even more than usual.
