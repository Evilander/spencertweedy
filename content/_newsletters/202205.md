Hi Observers.

I just got back from Denver, where Liam Kazar (along with me on drums and Lane Beckstrom on bass) was opening for Fruit Bats. We played two sold-out shows at the Bluebird Theater. They have a stunning marquee there. Fruit Bats ruled. We hiked. Weekend bliss.

Now I’m looking ahead to [Solid Sound](https://solidsoundfestival.com/), which is on May 27-29 this year. If you’ve been, you know how fun and special it is. If you’ve never been, this would be a great year to go for the first time. The lineup is ABSOLUTELY BONKERS. REALLY, [REALLY BONKERS](https://solidsoundfestival.com/lineup/). Many of my favorite bands, all in the same place, playing sets among art installations that expand your perception of the world…

Speaking of art, last week I opened [Spoon’s General Store](https://spoonsgeneralstore.com/), an online shop where I’m selling art by people I admire. It’s an experiment in curation/presentation/shipping/production. And it’s just plain for fun. There are cute indoor planters, guitar straps, beeswax candles, and a handful of other lovingly made stuff in this collection. [Check it out here](https://spoonsgeneralstore.com/).

I hope you’re enjoying the turn for better weather, if you live in a place that’s benefitting from that. If you don’t, well, I hope you’re hanging in there.

Thank yew,  
Spencer

# Observations

* The frequency with which I see elevators with inspection certificates unrenewed since 2020. <span>4-1</span>{: .date-code}
* The gas station bathroom ceiling fan’s brand: Nut One. <span>4-2</span>{: .date-code}
* The drunk woman walking down a busy Cincinnati street with friends: “I might’ve joined a cult in the bathroom.” <span>4-2</span>{: .date-code}
* The kids learning how to skateboard outside the pharmacy. One elder sage teen patiently teaching a super frustrated younger teen to control his irritation, to hop back on the board. <span>4-3</span>{: .date-code}
* The cook playing Nintendo Switch in the alley behind his restaurant. <span>4-3</span>{: .date-code}
* Showing photos from the road to my family in an AirPlay slideshow as if I were a midcentury vacationer who just came home with Kodak slides. <span>4-5</span>{: .date-code}
* Holding my friends’ newborn baby for the first time. <span>4-6</span>{: .date-code}
* The dramatic way the hospital transport tech opened the room’s curtain. <span>4-11</span>{: .date-code}
* The stagehand at The Auditorium furiously pulling ropes to open the curtain on cue for “I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.” <span>4-22</span>{: .date-code}
* The adorable way my Canadian friends say “fully” where Americans might say “totally.” <span>4-12</span>{: .date-code}
* The copy of Isabel Wilkerson’s *Caste* resting in the plane jet bridge operator’s window. <span>4-17</span>{: .date-code}
* Walking around Central Park with Sammy, finding the stone steps to the long-closed [Ramble Cave](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-ramble-cave-new-york-new-york). <span>4-18</span>{: .date-code}
* The woman “walking” her dog in a stroller at midnight in Manhattan. <span>4-19</span>{: .date-code}
* Touring two boats from 1885, the schooner Pioneer and the tall ship Wavertree, at New York’s [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/) (thanks Gabe [same Gabe as pictured above]). <span>4-20</span>{: .date-code}
* Standing, mesmerized by the [new fountain](https://jefftweedy.substack.com/p/chit-chat-check-in-30-lga) at LaGuardia Airport in New York. <span>4-21</span>{: .date-code}
* A Craigslist buyer, throwing in this poetic if not dour gem as we emailed to figure out a time for him to pick up lightbulbs we were giving away: “As I said, my day depends a lot on other people and things are getting exponentially flaky and unreliable lately, ironically to the point where I can’t even make serious plans of my own, or make the kind of promises I used and would like to.” <span>4-22</span>{: .date-code}
* *New York Times* [explaining](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/science/time-second-measurement.html) the formerly shaky, currently arbitrary way we measure the duration of seconds (which affects almost every other unit of measurement too): “We still tick through 1957-era seconds, even with our modern atomic clocks. That’s because the natural resonance frequency of cesium 133 was measured in 1957 and locked to the duration of the astronomical second in that year, a fact that will not change even when the second is redefined once more [by optical clocks].” <span>4-29</span>{: .date-code}
* Crimping hundreds of microphone channel conductors. <span>4-29</span>{: .date-code}
* Singing really does make work better. Having someone to sing with. <span>4-29</span>{: .date-code}
* Wilco playing “[Poor Places](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSAI7HWkuzU)” on Colbert. <span>4-18</span>{: .date-code}
