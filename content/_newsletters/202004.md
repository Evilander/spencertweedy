Hi Observations subscribers,

It’s already really cliché, but I have to (and want to) say it: I hope you’re well. I hope you’re healthy, safe, not obligated to work or endanger yourself, and finding company (whether virtual or IRL) in friends and family. I’m very grateful to be healthy with my family in Chicago right now, and finding lots of silver linings in all of the recent music- and resource-sharing going on. Those silver linings don’t come anywhere close to justifying the suffering and loss going on right now — nothing could, because it doesn’t work that way — but it does give me something positive to think about while we figure out what this means and how to continue through it.

Thanks for reading this newsletter and as always, if you wanna reply, you can just reply straight to this message.

## Mexico City
* The pulque bars, serape sellers, mariachi bands, and marimba players on floating stores and stages at the Xochimilco gondolas near Mexico City. <a href="{% link _observations/20200124.md %}" class="date-code">[1-24]</a>
* The high school students dancing and drinking mini bottles of SKYY vodka with straws as their gondola passed ours. <a href="{% link _observations/20200124.md %}" class="date-code">[1-24]</a>
* Walking around Mexico City. <a href="{% link _observations/20200122.md %}" class="date-code">[1-22]</a>
	* The impossibly sad-sounding organ grinders.
	* The denimed-out teenagers playing metal guitar to a track.
	* The moms with blankets, breastfeeding and changing diapers.
	* Lots of open making out.
* Buying a shirt from the Scouts de México (Boy/Girl Scouts) store with Mom. Then, running into a Scout meeting in a park, feeling grateful I wasn’t wearing my new uniform (lest I get mistaken for an eight-year-old Scout). <a href="{% link _observations/20200125.md %}" class="date-code">[1-25]</a>
* The street quesadilla seller making tortillas from scratch with gray putty-like dough dug out of a bucket. <a href="{% link _observations/20200125.md %}" class="date-code">[1-25]</a>

## At Sea
- Playing with Dad on the Cayamo Cruise while the ship pitched and rolled, feeling like if it rolled any farther, our amps and drums would fall over. <a href="{% link _observations/20200204.md %}" class="date-code">[2-4]</a>
* The huge windshield wipers on the ship bridge’s windows. <a href="{% link _observations/20200209.md %}" class="date-code">[2-9]</a>
* The creaking sounds of the ship’s elevator. <a href="{% link _observations/20200206.md %}" class="date-code">[2-6]</a>
* The medical tool dispenser aboard the ship, like a gas station wiener pill machine, named “Li’l Medic II.” <a href="{% link _observations/20200206.md %}" class="date-code">[2-6]</a>
* While docked in St. John’s, Antigua: <a href="{% link _observations/20200207.md %}" class="date-code">[2-7]</a>
	* The display of burned CD-R gospel records for sale on the street.
	* The pickup truck bed piled high with *huge* stuffed animals.
	* Walking into a dilapidated cricket stadium and finding a whole school of kids having recess in the bleachers, listening to “Stanky Legg” over the loudspeakers.
* Obama once said steering the country was like steering a cruise ship. Now I’ve seen a cruise ship turn surprisingly quickly and it seems like the country must be like steering something even bigger. <a href="{% link _observations/20200203.md %}" class="date-code">[2-3]</a>
