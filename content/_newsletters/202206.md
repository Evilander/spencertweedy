<small>*A waterfall in Massachusetts.*</small>

Alright, Observers. This month has been tough. I don’t think you need to hear anything from me about what the loss of Roe means, the harm it is already causing, and the actions available to us. So I’ll just say this: I follow the longtime, seasoned activists who say, “Of course this isn’t over.” Horrifying, damaging, and hard to overcome, yes. Over? No.

I want to mention also the tragic deaths discovered in San Antonio on Monday night. I can hardly imagine anything worse than what those people went through. I hope their families can find peace to the maximum extent possible, and that we can continue the desperately needed work of making immigration laws (and the global economy) fairer, more humane. Tall orders, but absolutely necessary if we give a shit about life.

OK — now I’ll share my little Observations notes with you.

Thank you. Please hang in there!

## Stories

* Ameena Walker’s story about the practice of Caribbean-American people shipping goods to their relatives — in [55-gallon barrels](https://theprepared.org/features-feed/shipping-barrels). <span>5-15</span>{: .date-code}
* “[How to Plant a Meme](https://donotresearch.net/posts/how-to-plant-a-meme)” by Joshua Citarella. <span>5-14</span>{: .date-code}
* “Funkadelic’s *Hardcore Jollies* made the cut, as did *Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols* and Captain Beefheart’s *Trout Mask Replica*.“ [The Untold Story of the White House’s Weirdly Hip Record Collection.](https://www.washingtonian.com/2022/05/03/the-untold-story-of-the-white-houses-weirdly-hip-record-collection/)” [Via Nichole — thank you!] <span>5-15</span>{: .date-code}
* [Alan Jacobs](https://blog.ayjay.org/dna/): “I don’t expect that anyone will be reading my stuff after I die — I expect that I’ll be wholly forgotten *before* I die, if I live to a good age — but I almost never think about that. At the end of *Middlemarch* George Eliot says of Dorothea that ‘the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts,’ and that captures better than I can my convictions on this point. *Diffusive* is the key word: an influence that subtly spreads, perhaps without anyone noticing. I find that model of influence more encouraging and comforting than any hopes for fame could ever be.” <span>5-25</span>{: .date-code}

## An Extremely Solid Sound

* Day one: Kicking off the festival with an Ohmme pop-up among [Amy Hauft’s installation](https://massmoca.org/event/amy-hauft/). Wilco performing all of *Cruel Country*. The release of *Cruel Country*! <span>5-27</span>{: .date-code}
* Day two: Playing with Liam to a super sweet, packed audience, the first show of the day. Lawrence Azerrad and me hosting the first in-person event for our [*Mirror Sound* book](https://mirrorsoundbook.com), which came out in 2020: a self-recording demo with Sam Evian and Liam. One of Sammy’s first solo electronic shows ever, a pop-up inside the museum. <span>5-28</span>{: .date-code}
* Day three: Playing cymbal and snare drum in Sam Evian’s “long tone” meditation pop-up performance inside the museum. Playing Liam’s new songs. Watching Sun Ra’s Arkestra led by Marshall Allen finish their set by marching off stage and continue playing music off stage for a few minutes, which moved me. Jeff Tweedy & Friends! David Byrne singing “California Stars” with us. <span>5-29</span>{: .date-code}
