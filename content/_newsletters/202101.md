Hello Observers,

HAPPY NEW YEAR!

I hope this year brings you way more joy and way less suffering, especially of the kind that‚Äôs caused by human jerks. Run-of-the-mill suffering caused by the flow of the universe is hard enough, I declare. We don‚Äôt need anyone adding to it. ESPECIALLY not on purpose, which, unbelievably, impossibly, some people do. So‚Ä¶ I hope for less of that, and more of the love that we try to live by, in 2021.

And thank you for your responses to my question / desperate pump-up plea about newsletter frequency and quality last time. You provided enough newsletter-related assurance to get me through the beginning of 2021, *at least*. It sounds like the monthly round-up format still works, so I‚Äôll keep it going.

(If you have any friends or colleagues or professors or adult children who might like OBSERVATIONS, you can send them a link to sign up [here](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/subscribe)!)

Thank you very, very much.  
On to the observin‚Äô.

Spencer

## November and December 2020

* Accidentally brushing my hair into paint primer, giving myself white frosted tips. [11-25]({% link _observations/20201125.md %}){: .date-code}
* Being terrified by, and reluctantly using, a powder-actuated hammer tool to fasten a wooden baseplate to concrete. [11-4]({% link _observations/20201104.md %}){: .date-code}
* Planting garlic with Mom. Getting my hands dirty with real, actual dirt from the ground for the first time in a long time. It felt good, spiritually and tactilely. The moss was mushy. [11-22]({% link _observations/20201122.md %}){: .date-code}

***

* The dancing in the streets ‚Äî joy that the election was finally called. [11-7]({% link _observations/20201107.md %}){: .date-code}
	* As my brother [put it](https://twitter.com/Sammytweedy/status/1325278670739689474): ‚ÄúNobody is celebrating today because they believe that our problems are all.. just solved. Everybody is celebrating that we will now have a chance to solve them.‚Äù
* Basil barking at the painting of the *Star Wars* (album) cat. [11-10]({% link _observations/20201110.md %}){: .date-code}
* The takeout container with Dad‚Äôs name spelled ‚Äújeef.‚Äù [11-19]({% link _observations/20201119.md %}){: .date-code}

***

* Photos of my grandma (bubba) Judy and me, scanned by Mom. Bubba‚Äôs sheer mag of bright liveliness showing through even in tiny photo format, twenty-five years later, not diminished at all. [12-5]({% link _observations/20201205.md %}){: .date-code}
* The professional sand sculptor practicing alone on the cold fall beach. [11-20]({% link _observations/20201120.md %}){: .date-code}
* The tiniest tumbleweed blowing across the highway. [12-23]({% link _observations/20201223.md %}){: .date-code}

***

* Petting Casey‚Äôs cats while she‚Äôs away, then going to my grandpa Zaid‚Äôs house and petting (massaging) Zaid. (To Zaid: you‚Äôre not a cat, but the acts of caring for you and for the cats bore an undeniable similarity today!) [12-20]({% link _observations/20201220.md %}){: .date-code}
* The little ramp in the artificial pond, for turtles and ducks and any other water-stranded local citizens. [12-26]({% link _observations/20201226.md %}){: .date-code}
* The window AC unit being held up by a weathered can of green beans. [12-3]({% link _observations/20201203.md %}){: .date-code}

***

## The North Branch
* A trip to the Chicago River‚Äôs north branch. [12-3]({% link _observations/20201203.md %}){: .date-code}
	* The beaver forming a little triangle wake behind her.
	* The huge blue heron, to whom I crept up slowly, trying to figure out if she was real or a statue. I‚Äôve been fooled by too many lawn ornaments.
	* Making some kind of happy noise when I saw eight or so ducks jumping into the current, one after the other.
	* The shopping list on the forest floor. First item: ‚ÄúDr. Scholl‚Äôs corn remover.‚Äù
	* The little gourd bobbing in the just-starting-to-freeze river.

## Some Music
* An ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù good groove: ‚Äú[So In Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx8_dhQpzzg)‚Äù by Curtis Mayfield. [11-6]({% link _observations/20201106.md %}){: .date-code}
* The music in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUuLmFdpuo) about installing drywall. [11-8]({% link _observations/20201108.md %}){: .date-code}
* Dr. John: ‚ÄúYour day is filled with money matters / My day is filled with sound‚Äù (‚Äú[Go Tell the People](https://youtu.be/I_PT7ecC9dM)‚Äù). [11-25]({% link _observations/20201125.md %}){: .date-code}
	* There are unbeLIEVable grooves all over that album, [*Desitively Bonnaroo*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kbJAX8vT8P44EowTu6PUi54P6s4oUKFo8). The Meters back him up on it, so, duh. (Thanks Liam for showing it to me.)

## Snow and Sugar

* Watching *Elf* as a family ‚Äî a triumph of art. [11-26]({% link _observations/20201126.md %}){: .date-code}
* How hard it is to open Chanukah gelt without getting chocolate under your fingernails. [12-12]({% link _observations/20201212.md %}){: .date-code}
* The ‚Äúthree-story‚Äù Christmas tree in the north suburbs of Chicago (three slices of Christmas tree: one in a first-floor window, another in the second, and the top on the roof). [12-12]({% link _observations/20201212.md %}){: .date-code}
* The contractor talking about the Christmas tree he bought this year ‚Äî and set up with a train underneath ‚Äî as a ‚Äústupid, costly idea.‚Äù [12-17]({% link _observations/20201217.md %}){: .date-code}
* That Casey gives me, a Jew, the honor of putting the star on her Christmas tree. [11-11]({% link _observations/20201111.md %}){: .date-code}
* Decorating cookies with Casey‚Äôs family. Baby Yoda ones, lizard ones, oops-I‚Äôll-just-douse-it-in-sprinkles ones. [12-24]({% link _observations/20201224.md %}){: .date-code}
* Kiki, Kristin, and Casey‚Äôs delicious Christmas Day *tostones* and *arroz con gandules*. [12-25]({% link _observations/20201225.md %}){: .date-code}
* How winter brings the pain of dry skin but also the joy of lotion. [11-4]({% link _observations/20201104.md %}){: .date-code}
* How the snow makes everything brighter. There‚Äôs more light in the windows. [12-29]({% link _observations/20201229.md %}){: .date-code}
