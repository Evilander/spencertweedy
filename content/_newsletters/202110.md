Hi Observers! I hope you’re doing well.

(I’m [Spencer Tweedy](https://spencertweedy.com/) and this is my newsletter, Observations. If you don’t want to get these anymore, no problem — <unsubscribe>unsubscribe here</unsubscribe>.)

Here’s what I’m up to this month and next:

* This weekend (Oct. 29-31), the beloved **Cosmic Country Showcase** returns with two shows at the Hideout in Chicago and one show at Cactus Club in Milwaukee. The shows are headlined by Lavender Country, whose 1973 debut record BLEW MY MIND and will blow yours too if you listen to it. People call it the first openly gay country record. Openly gay might be an understatement. It’s joyous, righteous music. The showcase shows are always fun and I think this one will be even more memorable with Patrick involved. I’m drumming. [Tickets here](https://www.localuniverse.net/cosmiclavendertour).
* This Wednesday and for at least two Wednesdays after that, I’ll be broadcasting my new audio show **Drum Diary** on Blast Radio. The show is a mix of talking, drumming, and sharing music. Episodes air at 5PM Central and stay up for 24 hours after that. Listen on [Blast Radio](https://blastradio.com/spencertweedy) if you like.
* In November, **Kelly Hogan** is opening two shows for **MAVIS STAPLES** in Chicago — one at Thalia Hall and one at Fitzgerald’s, in Berwyn. I’ll be playing in Kelly’s band (for the first time!) and then gazing admiringly at my grandma, Mavis. [Tickets here](https://mavisstaples.com/tour).
* Lastly but not leastly, my family will be walking in the annual **Light the Night walk** for leukemia and lymphoma research on Saturday, October 30. We’ve been walking for years led by mom, who is healthy thanks in part to research that Leukemia and Lymphoma Society funds. [Join the walk or donate here](https://pages.lls.org/ltn/chi/Metrochicago21/SMillerTweedy).

And that’s it! My favorite OBSERVATIONS posts from the past two months below. Thanks for being here.

Oh yeah, two bonus things: my dad has a new [Sub Pop single out now](https://ffm.to/jefftweedy_cmonamerica), and my book [Mirror Sound](https://mirrorsoundbook.com/) is one year old — here it is at [your local bookstore](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9783791386539) and on [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/books/mirror-sound-the-people-and-processes-behind-self-recorded-music/9783791386539).
