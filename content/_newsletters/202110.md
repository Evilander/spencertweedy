Hi Observers! I hope you’re doing well.

(I’m [Spencer Tweedy](https://spencertweedy.com/) and this is my newsletter, Observations. If you don’t want to get these anymore, no problem — <unsubscribe>unsubscribe here</unsubscribe>.)

Here’s what I’m up to this month and next:

* This weekend (Oct. 29-31), the beloved **Cosmic Country Showcase** returns with two shows at the Hideout in Chicago and one show at Cactus Club in Milwaukee. The shows are headlined by Lavender Country, whose 1973 debut record BLEW MY MIND and will blow yours too if you listen to it. People call it the first openly gay country record. Openly gay might be an understatement. It’s joyous, righteous music. The showcase shows are always fun and I think this one will be even more memorable with Patrick involved. I’m drumming. [Tickets here](https://www.localuniverse.net/cosmiclavendertour).
* This Wednesday and for at least two Wednesdays after that, I’ll be broadcasting my new audio show **Drum Diary** on Blast Radio. The show is a mix of talking, drumming, and sharing music. Episodes air at 5PM Central and stay up for 24 hours after that. Listen on [Blast Radio](https://blastradio.com/spencertweedy) if you like.
* In November, **Kelly Hogan** is opening two shows for **MAVIS STAPLES** in Chicago — one at Thalia Hall and one at Fitzgerald’s, in Berwyn. I’ll be playing in Kelly’s band (for the first time!) and then gazing admiringly at my grandma, Mavis. [Tickets here](https://mavisstaples.com/tour).
* Lastly but not leastly, my family will be walking in the annual **Light the Night walk** for leukemia and lymphoma research on Saturday, October 30. We’ve been walking for years led by mom, who is healthy thanks in part to research that Leukemia and Lymphoma Society funds. [Join the walk or donate here](https://pages.lls.org/ltn/chi/Metrochicago21/SMillerTweedy).

And that’s it! My favorite OBSERVATIONS posts from the past two months below. Thanks for being here.

# Observations

* The three chickens walking around in our alley.
* The rabbit (or rabbit-adjacent animal) hole in the backyard that Basil monitors obsessively.
* The little frog hopping around at the outdoor Wilco, Sleater-Kinney, and NNAMDÏ show in St. Louis.

***

* Melvin, the sweet, 70-year-old electrical contractor with a Kangol cap, burping loudly in our hallway.
* The woman pushing a baby in a stroller through a park bustling with music festival preparations: forklifts, trucks, golf carts.
* The avid festival-goer [[2021-07-21]({% link _observations/20210721.md %})] explaining that he wants to teach peace through hacky sack.

***

* Swimming in the hot-as-air water in Lake Monroe with friends Charles, Malcolm, Macie, and Sima.
* Driving all day, then sitting down at my drum seat only to wonder where the seat belt was.
* Finding the only good use for a MyPillow charlatan pillow: dampening a kick drum.

***

* The block-long line outside the DMV anxiously watching the impending storm clouds.
* The older man kneeling, chopping up a tree stump with a hatchet.
* The roadside ad for “iBaptism.”

***

* George Saunders’ beautiful *New Yorker* story, “[The Mom of Bold Action](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/30/the-mom-of-bold-action).” Weeks later, still thinking about the floaters in the dog bowl.
* The sweet Iowan couple dining next to us, a loud-ish band, on a patio: “Are you all a band? I can smell a band from a mile away.”
* My friend Warner telling me that my jawbone looks like that of “some cool lizard skulls” he’s found.

***

* The purple sunrise light seeping in the bedroom windows.
* The minute scratches on the surface on John McCracken’s [Red Plank](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/33775/red-plank), reminding me that it’s a real object, not a Platonic form, and making me wonder about its many years of being carted around and whatever other events have occurred in its life since 1969.
* The strata of years in my tour laminate memory box.

***

* The older couple wrapping birthday gifts in the trunk of their minivan, in the drizzly parking lot of a rural gas station.
* The little lights blinking on the stationary barges on the Mississippi River.
* That genetic diversity leads to evolutionary security, not to mention beauty, in plant and animal species. One of nature’s most constructive, affirming statements.

***

## Music
* “[Climb Every Wall](https://lump.bandcamp.com/track/climb-every-wall)” by Lump.
* Liam’s new album, [*Due North*](https://liamkazar.bandcamp.com/album/due-north)! Four-plus years in the making! I play drums.
* “[Ana Damir El Motakallim](https://habibifunkrecords.bandcamp.com/track/ana-damir-el-motakallim)” by Issam Hajali.
