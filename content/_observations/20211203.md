- The [Musical Instrument Museum](https://mim.org/) in Phoenix. Six hours of wide-eyed, wide-eared experience. So fun.
	- The countless folk instruments from hundreds of cultures around the world, often displayed alongside video footage of musicians from that culture playing the very same instrument.
	- The painstaking detail of a *tonbak* drum made out of thousands of tiny pieces of wood and bone.
	- The massive, carved slot drums.
	- The teeny, funnily shaped proto-violins.
	- The recreations of a Pacific region traditional cymbal forge, a violin luthier shop, a Martin luthier shop, and a Steinway factory.
	- The sensation of hitting a reproduction *pow wow* drum in the museum’s “experience center.” It’s so wide, and its sound is so low, it really makes you feel something.
	- Overhearing someone ask if a photo of Steve Vai was Neil Young.
	- Doug Clifford’s (of CCR) Camco drums. Hal Blaine’s cymbals. Parts of the “Pictures of Lily” kit Keith Moon played on Smothers Brothers! I was shocked at how emotional it made me to see those things, especially the Moon kit. Watching those drums [explode](https://youtu.be/TZkjA8DTg4o?t=309){: .music} was a formative part of my childhood.
	- The woman playing a shaker in the gift shop saying, proudly, to an employee, “I like noise.”
