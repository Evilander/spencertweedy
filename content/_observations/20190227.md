- Listening to the Michael Cohen testimony with Zaid in his room at the post-hospital rehab center.
	- How you don’t need to think Cohen is a good guy or fully reformed in order to see that Republican representatives were protecting Trump and misconstruing how witness testimony works in the first place.
- At a fundraiser for Poverty Alleviation Chicago:
	- a playlist of Top 40 hits but with violin solos superimposed on them;
	- the biggest table of meats and cheeses I’ve ever seen, sweating.
- Liam’s last shift at the Hungry Brain.
	- Jeremy Cunningham’s delicious, tasteful drumming.
