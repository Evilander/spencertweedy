- Faye Webster sorta sounding like an Atlantan Andy Shauf on her new record, *Atlanta Millionaires Club*.
- “Love 2 Fast” by Steve Lacy.
- “Angelic Weirdness” by Guided By Voices.
- While listening to Bowie’s *Blackstar*: The joy of Bowie being his old, recognizable self while also making something modern-sounding and new for him.
