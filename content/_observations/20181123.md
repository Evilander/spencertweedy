- The vacuum-sealed boiled corn for sale on the counter at 7-Eleven.
- Mom handing a cardboard box to me via grabby claw extender thing.
- Letting the spider who has been in our bathtub for weeks stay there. Being amazed at the prolific, hefty poopwork he did beneath the web.
	- [On 12-10-18, getting this text from Mom: "I’m so sad. The cleaning people just left. They hadn’t been here in a couple of months. And I ran into the bathroom after they left and the spider and his mess are gone. I feel sad and guilty."]
