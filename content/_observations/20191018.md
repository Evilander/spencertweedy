- Lætitia Tamko (Vagabon) in a Stereogum interview (she used to work in electrical engineering): “[…] I still wake up in the morning … do some integrated circuit equation, just to remind myself that I’m a full person. My personality is pretty obsessive, so if I just allow myself to do one thing and I let my identity just rely on that one thing, I would crumble. It took me a while to figure out that I need to do other things to be able to continue having a healthy relationship with music.”
- Big Thief at Metro in Chicago. Heart eyes.
