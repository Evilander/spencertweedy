- Anand Giridharadas in [The Ink](https://the.ink/p/they-want-to-steal-this-seat-for):
> The fight to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg [is] a fight over what your days are like.
> 
> You want your feet to hurt less at the end of the day. They want to crush the union fighting for your breaks…
> 
> You want to wake up in the morning thinking about the business you’re going to start. They want you to wake up in the middle of the night sweating about the health benefits you’d lose…
> 
> You want to learn what you need to be a good citizen and get ahead in a tough economy. They want you balled and chained with debt, paying them interest forever. That’s why they will do anything to steal this seat.
