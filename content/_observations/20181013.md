- Recording without a tea towel on my snare drum for the first time in, like, forever.
- Stumbling upon an eBay listing for an anti-Kaepernick, anti-Nike, anti-Black-Lives-Matter "art print” that looks like it was designed in Microsoft Paint, with a 1,463-word, racist screed in its product description.
	- “The image will be printed on a glossy paper in high definition. All sales are final. I'm not thinking about myself. What? All you Facebooger diks can't figure that out?”
	- “A.I. is going to destroy your lives! 5G is the baby step. Then comes Skynet.”
	- “[The globalist elites] think about $Green, not N*gga, Black, Whatever.”
	- Its weird combination of anticapitalist rage, which would sound at-home in a punk zine, and racist nationalism.
	- How it becomes like a diary toward the end, with *dated updates* on seemingly irrelevant current events, like Dr. Ford's testimony at the Kavanaugh hearings.
	- Its idiosyncratic use of question marks.
- Walking outside to find a woodpecker-looking bird on our porch.
- Baking pies with Casey.
	- Finding a jar of McCormick whole clove spice from 1988 in our cabinet. Considering using it in our pumpkin pie, but deciding against it.
