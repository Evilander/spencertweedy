- The super cool stationery shops, toy stores, and food kiosks in San Franciscoâ€™s Japantown. Sammy and I trying to go to the 115-year-old Benkyodo mochi shop only to miss their line cutoff by one person. The imported tools in the hardware store. Ordering some kimchi fried puff ball things and discovering that they had tiny pieces of octopus in them.
- The Fillmore night 2!
