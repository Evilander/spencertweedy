- Rehearsing in MASS MoCA underneath the footsteps of Solid Sound attendees on the floor above, wondering if they could hear us.
- Jonathan Richman sounding great, being funny, affirming life during his show, as always.
- Playing with Dad, Sammy, Jim, Liam, and friends, while a short rain shower birthed a rainbow right behind the audience. Dad pointed to it and said, "Look at that stupid rainbow."
