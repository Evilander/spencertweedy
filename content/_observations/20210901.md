- One very loose formulation of Kant’s Categorical Imperative goes like: *Do what you wish everyone else would do.* And by the same token: *If the world would be worse off if everyone were to do what you’re considering doing, don’t do it.* But it’s kind of strange to make decisions based on notions of collective action without integrating ideas about how collective action itself works (e.g. how people influence each other, how the consequences of a Kantian “maxim” change depending on the specific quantity of people living by it). I suspect that Kant and many others have written about the interaction between his Categorical Imperative and group dynamics but I haven’t read them yet.
	- Cases that make me consider how the Categorical Imperative interacts with group dynamics: voting for third party candidates; participating in boycotts.
