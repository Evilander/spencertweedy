- A mini-blizzard.
	- Everyone in the neighborhood outside, tending to the snow.
	- The shadow of snow piled up behind the frosted bathroom window.
	- The trash cans frozen shut.
	- My canvas Blundstones losing badly to the snow.
- Endlessly, desperately trying to unsubscribe from Groupon newsletters.
- Wondering what Dick Van Dyke is up to?
- Calling in a broken street light to Chicago's 311, getting a text back that included a TinyURL link. They also sign some texts “- Mayor Emanuel.”
- The Aeon article about epistocracy, “The right to vote should be restricted to those with knowledge.” Being surprised that it was less elitist than it sounds but still uncomfortable with its, um, elitism.
- Craig Mod's essay about "giv[ing] edges to something that fundamentally doesn't have an edge, that doesn't have a container around it," why it's worthwhile to do that, how you can do that (e.g. with a book).
