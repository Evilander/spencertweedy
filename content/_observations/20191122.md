- The “high tea” service in the St. Paul Hotel’s lobby reminding me exactly of the way my grandma and grandpa’s house in Belleville smelled (though they didn’t serve tea).
- The woman on the train carrying a plant in a Tupperware container.
- The Lyft driver who said he could tell I was a drummer from my hair.
