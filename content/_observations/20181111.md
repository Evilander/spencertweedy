- Ramen with Phoebe.
- The Green River Project sculpture/furniture design Instagram and gallery (via Phoebe), the latter of which is in a brownstone's basement and has stones for its floor.
- The prevalence of those winter-glove bike handlebar things in New York.
- That argumentative move where people doing reprehensible things argue that they’re in the right because they’re honest about the reprehensibleness of the things they're doing. Or at least that they're better than *other* people who do *other* reprehensible things but who aren't honest about it.
- A short apartment visit and Jeopardy-watching session with Gabe, Abbey, and Sarah.
- The storefront that was pitch-black except for a fluorescent light right over a bird cage (with birds).
- The super sweet people (staff and otherwise) at the Murmrr Theatre.
