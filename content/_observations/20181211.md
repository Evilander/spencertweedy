- Admiring the in-counter cup cleaner things they have at bars and coffee shops.
- The vacant storefront with nothing inside except for a drum kit in the window, facing inward.
- Elvin Jones’s drumming on the newly released Coltrane “lost album.”
- The amazing visualization of population density on Pudding.cool.
- The nice, farm-to-table restaurant using New Amsterdam vodka bottles as water jugs.
- Feeling frustrated as ever that conservatives support a totally free market because they’re afraid of being dominated or imposed upon by the government, but we have way more recourse with the government than we do with the companies in our lives (e.g. even my beloved Apple). Good luck trying to oust Tim Cook. It’s much easier to run your own congressperson.
