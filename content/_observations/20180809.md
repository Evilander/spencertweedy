- The two Canadian motorcycle couples (Ontario plates), riding together on 94, one with a cigarette dangling out of his mouth.
- The catfish delivery truck. A truck just for delivering catfish.
- Drumming for a friendâ€™s beautiful, Skip Spence-esque outsider country songs.
- The ghoulish wall painting, including pointy nips, of a dancing woman at the Mexican restaurant.
- The dad jogging, doing jumping jacks on the corner while his infant lay in a stroller.
