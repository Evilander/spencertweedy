- The lizards all over the streets in New Orleans. Jumping from the ground onto trash cans. Observing us from perches on fences.
- The power lines along the Louisiana interstate reaching out seemingly endlessly into the ocean.
- Wanting to liberate the Chick-fil-A billboard plastic cows from their dastardly job.
- The bucket drummers in rhythmic harmony with the trumpet player on the opposite end of Jackson Park.
