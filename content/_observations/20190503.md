- Michael Slote on the relationship between caring/empathy and thinking/rationality: “[…] Even if morality isn’t based on reason, there is no reason to suppose that moral individuals, as conceived by care ethics, have no need for their rational, or reasoning, powers. A mother who cares about her child wants to know how to do what is good for her child, and this involves knowing and initially learning all sorts of nutritional and medical facts, just for starters” (*The Ethics of Care and Empathy* 120).
