- Case Oats playing with Warner Brownfield and Bats (Jess Awh) at Mag Bar in Louisville.
	- Warner’s wonderful, free writing and performing style.
	- Nick Larimore, an absolute ripper pedal steel player, always a joy to hear.
	- The older, drunk, white ponytailed man who harrassed Casey, Jess, Chloe each separately with acts that included showing them pictures of his girlfriend’s boobs. Thankfully he showed himself out.
