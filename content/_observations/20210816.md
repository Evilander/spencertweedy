- The minute scratches you can see on the surface on John McCracken’s *[Red Plank](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/33775/red-plank)* in the right light, reminding you that it’s just like any other piece of lacquered fiberglass — that is, not invincible — making me wonder about its many years of being carted around and whatever other events have occurred in the sculpture’s life since 1969.
- The apparent evidence of sanding around the concavities’ edges in Barbara Hepworth’s *[Two Figures](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65839/two-figures-menhirs)*.
- Andrew Sa’s *[Andrew in Anotherland](https://noonchorus.com/Andrew-Sa/?ltclid=862590e4-52ce-401d-abb3-889cba6b0f92){: .music}*.
