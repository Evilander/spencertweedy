	- The wind drying our hair.
- The army of plastic snowmen lawn ornaments on a neighboring farm’s lawn.
- The diversity of folding chairs at the festival.
	- Two with hydraulic rockers.
	- Two with headrests, reclinable.
- The band members sluggishly carrying gear to the barn.
- It’s possible that blues scales need to be banned, at least for white people.
- Eating Avrom Farm chicken, my only allowed chicken.
- The father-and-sons punk band.
	- The bassist son reminding me of Steve Albini and my friend Gabe.
	- The guitarist son reminding me of young Dad.
- Al Scorch commanding the audience in a special way, singing new, sadder, slower songs.
