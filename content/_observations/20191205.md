- In the din of noises from a huge construction site, you sometimes hear a few regular hammer hits, which makes me think: itâ€™s amazing that anything so micro-level and unmechanized is part of building something so big.
- The sound tech with a Gretsch shirt, two Gretsch tattoos, and a son named Gretsch.
- The good Jewish pickle at a coffee shop in Sheboygan, WI.
- A winter classic: a dump truck full of snow.
