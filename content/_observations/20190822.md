- The little paper doilies on which this farm restaurant served its sandwiches.
- Gently slipping on a rock and falling into Sam Owens’s (Sam Evian’s) creek. Sam felt bad; it wasn’t his fault.
	- Blow-drying my shoes when I got back to my hotel.
- Driving through torrential rain in a rented lime green Kia Soul.
