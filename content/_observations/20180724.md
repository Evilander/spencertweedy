- Emailing, writing, watching baking shows with Casey.
- The yummy eggs she cooked.
- Switching to Siteleaf so I don’t have to git commit every new post like an NSA contractor.
	- The Siteleaf website being so clear and humane it makes me wanna cry.
- Casey’s microwave with time preset buttons (1 second, 10 seconds, 1 minute?) instead of a number pad. Wondering which interface is more useful, tentatively siding with the presets.
- The phone call with a friend who sounded somehow weary but still optimistic.
- Shopping for pet cowboy hats, finding the world’s most important dog-in-wig portrait instead.
- The summer smell, better than usual.
- The Elevator Constructors Union Local 2 license plate frame. Learning that there’s an Elevator Constructors Union Local 2.
- The Costco shrimp that Mom brought home.
- The ‘80s plastic rocking horse that Mom brought home.
- Having hardly moved at all after seven days of constant physical work.
- Vacuuming the pieces of protein bar I left while frantically eating, post-festival-teardown, at 5:45AM on Monday (7-23-18) morning.
