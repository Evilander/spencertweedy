* The dulcimer-like sound generated by something rattling inside of a flagpole in Atmore, Alabama.
* The sun-faded image of a zillion peppers on a grocery store window looking like flappy, used condoms.
* Wondering what personal objects remain in the cars crushed, stacked, and wrapped up for recycling.
* The super sweet staff and great sound at Eddieâ€™s Attic in Decatur, Georgia.
