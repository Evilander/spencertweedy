- Our bizarrely wintery, snowy Halloween in Chicago.
	- Hanging around a fire pit (which Mom masterfully lit) and handing out candy to trick-or-treaters with Mom, Casey, and Basil, who was wrapped in many blanket layers.
	- The big tree limb that fell into the street from the weight of snow, thankfully on no one and no cars.
