- Refilling Casey’s cats’ food storage container before remembering to pull the scooper out. Faced with a choice between pouring the container back into the bag or shoving my arm in elbow-deep, I chose the latter. But the pressure of the bikkies was too great; I wasn’t able to get a good grip. I poured the container back into the bag, with minimal spillage. My forearm was oiled. The scooper was retrieved.
