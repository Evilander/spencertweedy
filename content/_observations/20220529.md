- Day three of Solid Sound. Playing cymbal and snare drum in Sam Evian’s “long tone” meditation pop-up performance inside the museum. Playing Liam’s new songs. Watching Sun Ra’s Arkestra led by Marshall Allen end their set marching off stage and continue playing music off stage for a few minutes, which moved me. Jeff Tweedy & Friends! David Byrne singing “California Stars” with us.
