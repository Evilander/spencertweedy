- Delivering gifts with Letters to Santa (visit pac.charity).
	- The welcome mat in a makeshift basement apartment.
	- The lack of toxic pride or angst in the families we met—just pure gratitude.
	- The reaction of one kid, Isaac, who was basically a caricature of an excited child. He kissed one of our organizers, Val, on the cheek.
- The ice cream trucks crammed into a lot in a residential neighborhood.
- The MetroPCS sign in the chassis of an old Blockbuster sign.
- The relief of a veggie burrito after driving around all day, and eating my first tortilla chip post-wisdom-teeth-surgery (they’re sharp).
