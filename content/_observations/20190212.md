- The snowblowers with those little canvas cabs on them.
- The flare stacks on the paper factory across the river.
- The deer standing just a few feet outside my studio window.
- An upside of my recent three-day (and going) bout of diarrhea: I finally learned how to spell diarrhea consistently.
- Using my Swiss army knife toothpick to get food out of my still-open wisdom tooth hole [1-6-19 et al.].
