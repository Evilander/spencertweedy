- Learning that Irwindale, California has public healthcare, and that insurance companies act as “shadow regulators” of municipal police departments, via Planet Money.
- The woman who tried to light a cigarette on my flight to Los Angeles.
	- Earlier in the flight, the commotion that followed her getting melted chocolate all over her clothes and hands.
	- At the end of the flight, her asking a flight attendant whether she had ever seen “Trump’s plane” on the tarmac.
- The older man welding in his open garage.
- John Carroll Kirby’s awesome, sad, restrained, spacious organ music at Zebulon in LA.
