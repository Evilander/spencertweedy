- The Gary, Indiana airport landing strobe lights lighting up the sky.
- The tinsel streamers (geese deterrents) in a tree in a small town in Indiana, lit up by my headlights.
- The pothole in a church parking lot filled to the rim not with rainwater, but with petals fallen from the blooming tree above it.
