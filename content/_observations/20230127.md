- [George Saunders](https://open.substack.com/pub/georgesaunders/p/calling-back?r=62534&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web): “I think I’m a bit like a pitcher with a limited repertoire of pitches – just a fastball, a curve, and change-up, let’s say.  So I have to keep using these pitches, trying to make them better within their own limitations … Somehow, I feel this as a sign of maturity: the acceptance of one’s limitations and a resolve to work energetically and quirkily, and in a slightly ornery spirit, within them.”
