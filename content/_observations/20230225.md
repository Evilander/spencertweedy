- The dad picking up his daughter from school in a mini pickup truck (of a size you only ever see on airport tarmacs or in Europe/Asia).
- Laurel Schwulstâ€™s [interview with Bill Wurtz](https://html.energy/bill.html) on HTML Energy.
- [When all of my friends are on at once](https://allmyfriendsatonce.com), a super cute website.
- The [Syncrowd](https://nor.tokyo/syncrowd) kinetic sound installation.
- I never realized, until I read [this edition of The Whippet](https://thewhippet.org/162-nectar-crash/), that deoxygenated blood goes to the heart before it goes to the lungs, and then *back* again to the heart before it gets pushed out to the rest of the body. In the heart twice. Whoa.
