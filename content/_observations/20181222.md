- Smelling a fresh turd from Casey’s cat and feeling like it went directly into my brain.
- Sammy’s birthday: watching *King of the Hill* and *Tales from the Tour Bus* together.
- Passing a Peter Francis Geraci law office (in a former Taco Bell) and wondering: do law school graduates choose to work there, or do they view it as the only option when more elite law firms are out of reach? Do they enjoy it? It seems to me, an outsider, like McDonald’s: a service (low-cost, highly available legal help) that only exists because there’s no adequate public sector option, and which can only be staffed because there’s a dearth of opportunity for so many young people.
