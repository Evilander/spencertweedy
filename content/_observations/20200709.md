- Embarking on a last-minute road trip to New York to get Sammy’s stuff out of his COVID-closed dorm room.
	- How Mom’s minivan automatically turns down the air conditioning fan speed when you’re on a speaker phone call. Neat!
	- The dump truck driver eating ice cream out of the bucket.
	- The railroad service cars with axles mounted on them, so they can drive on the tracks (I think?).
	- The littlest deer, donkey, and calf grazing at highway-side farms.
