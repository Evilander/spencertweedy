- Drumming for a friend at her living room show in a super sweet, cooperatively run art house.
	- The house tambourine that happened to be shaped like a Jesus fish.
- Killing a mosquito while listening to a homework-assigned interview with philosopher Peter Singer about the ethics of our interactions with animals.
- Getting a really, really sweet check-in text from a friend.
