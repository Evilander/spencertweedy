- The zillions of business-to-business stores selling construction tools, emergency vehicle lights, and restaurant refrigerators in Mexico City.
- The gondolas at Xochimilco.
	- Ordering full meals and gallon-sized micheladas from vendor gondolas that sidled up and docked next to ours while they prepared our stuff.
	- The pulque bars, serape sellers, mariachi bands, and marimba players on their own floating stores and stages.
	- The high school students dancing and drinking mini bottles of SKYY vodka with straws on a party gondola.
	- The Venus flytraps and reptile riverside attractions we elected to skip.
