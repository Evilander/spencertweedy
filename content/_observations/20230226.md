- Nice morning recording improvised duo drums at ████’s apartment. Fish tank bubbling in background. Peavey console. Craigslist gear.
- “[To find a form that accommodates the mess](https://austinkleon.com/2021/12/21/finding-a-form-that-accommodates-the-mess/),” from Austin Kleon.
- Lots of friends lately talking about struggling to find a manager or agent or publicist or label, recognizing that they would benefit from working with one.
