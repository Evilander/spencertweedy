- Touring Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin West with Aunt Debbie and Casey (which happened to be displaying Chihuly glass sculptures too).
	- The slanted ceilings; the constricting doorways the release into open, airy spaces; the geodesic-looking armchairs; the utter coziness and low tables of the dens.
	- Feeling surprised, disappointed, and encouraged all at the same time about the sometimes shoddy building quality of the property. Not its poor maintenance, but its rickety construction from the get-go. (The guide informed us that much of the campus was constructed by Wright’s students, who weren’t builders but architects.)
