- Thinking that my room (and the world) had literally gotten darker to my eyes because I was feeling sad, but then realizing that it was because a cloud had passed over the sun. Classic mistake.
- Watching the BBC documentary about Ronnie Lane, *The Passing Show*, and crying!
	- How Ronnie’s main bass traveled through the years, played by different bandmates in different bands of his.
- Rehearsing with the school’s Afrocuban drum ensemble and being slowly brought back to life with every cowbell hit.
- My classmate in the Balinese gamelan ensemble telling us during a break that he was having a bad day, another classmate volunteering to give him a hug (which he graciously accepted), and then all of us standing up to form a hug-line for him.
- My mom posting about a kind of unexpected development with her liposarcoma, which had been treated a few years ago, and watching loving comments pour in (to both of us).
- Using a power saw, alone, to finish an assignment (a cardboard replica of my childhood “TV chair”) in the sculpture studio at 3AM.
