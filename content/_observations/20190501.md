- Accidentally throwing out gum in a trash can with no bag and feeling bad about it. (The can was slightly too deep, and the social situation slightly too weird, to dig it out, Father.)
- The sound of the rotary phone ringing at Fireside Bowl.
- Getting turned down by U.S. Bank for a free checking account because Haydenâ€™s and my business, [Avrom Farm Party](https://avromfarmparty.com/), has only seasonal revenue (?!). [Update 5-18-19: Hayden was able to open the account at another location.]
