- Trying to better understand Liz Pelly’s new Baffler piece about Spotify. Is it so bad that people want to listen to music in the background? Or is the blameworthiness not in their listening, but in the way Spotify and labels/artists are using data to precision-engineer music for background listening? I think active listening is worthwhile and important but I’m not sure that people are wrong to be background listeners per se.
