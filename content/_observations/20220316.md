- Waking up before the sun rose to finish our drive to Austin. Arriving at Spider House in Austin for our first SXSW showcase, a half-hour before getting on stage to play (not our MO!).
- The ultra-kind proprietor of Cafe Yaya in Austin, who, after asking about the name of our band, ran out to the van as we were leaving, blasting “Shoes Too Tight” from his phone, telling us he likes the music.
- Jason harmonica-soloing at a jam-hang at the end of the day. Max kazoo-soloing.
