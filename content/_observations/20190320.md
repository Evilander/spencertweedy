- The *New Yorker* interview with Donna Brazile about her new position at Fox News.
	- Isaac Chotiner, the interviewer, seeming to pin Brazile for equivocating on Fox’s depravity, but then kinda getting his ass kicked right back by Brazile: “Don’t call me and act as if you are somehow appalled that a black woman, or a woman, or a liberal progressive, would go, ‘Hell, yeah, I want to go in that den.’ And I want to fight from inside and fight from the outside. I may be naïve in my judgment, but I am wise in my view that, long term, we are not going to make progress by simply being out throwing rocks.”
	- Seeing Brazile’s point, but still wondering whether it’s possible to fight behind enemy lines, as she says she’s doing, without being a collaborator or an accomplice to terrible stuff. She’s gathering info and trying to use Fox’s influence for good, but she’s also building their product and helping their bottom line. Trusting that she knows more about this biz than I do.
- Chemi Rosado-Seijo’s Whitney Biennial 2017 piece, in which a classroom from Lower Manhattan Arts Academy traded places with a Whitney gallery for the duration of the exhibition.
