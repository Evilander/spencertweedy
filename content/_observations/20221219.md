- Arriving pretty much straight off the road from Oklahoma City to the Letters to Santa 24 Hour Comedy and Music Marathon, where [The Blisters](https://theblistersband.bandcamp.com/) played a set marking the TWENTIETH anniversary of our first appearance there, our first show ever.
- Listening to some songs on *[Cured](https://theblistersband.bandcamp.com/album/cured)*, The Blisters’ album from 2016, feeling proud of our effort!
- [Ai Weiwei in Sixtysix](https://sixtysixmag.com/ai-weiwei/): “Fortunately as an artist I can use a language that is vague and abstract.”
