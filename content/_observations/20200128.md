- Tonika Johnson’s [Folded Map Project](https://www.foldedmapproject.com/), which shows images of mirror addresses on Chicago’s north-south axis (e.g. 6720 S. Ashland and 6720 N. Ashland) to “reveal the inequity … how Chicago’s legacy of segregation has impacted the neighborhoods.” And her “map twin” portraits, which “introduc[e] people living on different sides of the city and ge[t] them to really talk with each other — that’s how the map becomes ‘folded’ and ‘touches.’”
