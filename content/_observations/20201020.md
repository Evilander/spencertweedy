- The car transport truck almost getting stuck under a viaduct. The driver getting out, smiling and laughing at his near-handiwork. Ten minutes later, me, walking home on a different street. Heâ€™s driving on it, having found a safe route around the viaduct. I give him a thumbs-up and he thumbs-ups back.
- The lawn-mowing robots on a corporate campus in the suburbs.
- The release of [Mirror Sound](https://mirrorsoundbook.com/), a book about musicians who self-record I created with Lawrence Azerrad and Daniel Topete. [Available here](https://mirrorsoundbook.com/). ðŸ˜Š
