- At the dog beach, the tiny, hairless chihuahua with such a disturbingly large penis and ballsack that it had difficulty walking.
- The translucent pink plastic Kraft Singles container from my childhood.
- Lately, feeling surprised that older people see me as an adult, someone to whom they can talk. I’ve appreciated that for a while, but it’s striking me as weird and partly undeserved recently.
