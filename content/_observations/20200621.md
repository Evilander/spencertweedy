- Attending the musiciansâ€™ march I had tried to attend on [6-14-20]({% link _observations/20200614.md %}).
	- The older, white, gray-pony-tailed fellow marcher wearing a plain yellow t-shirt, yellow striped pants, and carrying what I think was a flute.
	- The inspiring, kind leaders of the march, members of the [Blck Rising](https://www.instagram.com/blckrising/) collective.
