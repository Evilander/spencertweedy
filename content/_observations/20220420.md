- Touring two boats from 1885, the schooner Pioneer and the tall ship Wavertree, at the [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/) (thanks Gabe).
- The last of five amazing *Yankee Hotel Foxtrot* 20th Anniversary shows in New York, during which Wilco played the album with its original arrangements, with help from Total Pro Horns and [Aizuri Quartet](https://www.aizuriquartet.com/). Me, basically crying through each of the three shows I saw.
