- Peeling Jeltrate off my hands in sculpture class.
- Watching liquid plastic dry.
- Hearing a student ask a professor if he smokes weed.
- The studio art custom of â€œknolling," putting away unused tools and tidying your workspace.
- Yanking one long, white hair out of my eyebrow.
- The anti-Whitaker protest in downtown Appleton, small but affirming.
	- A shirtless guy wandering through.
	- The news anchor lugging a tripod around, producing her own segment.
- The flatbed of Christmas trees, on their way.
- Still buying plastic bags at the grocery store, stupidly, years after the Chicago bag tax was introduced.
