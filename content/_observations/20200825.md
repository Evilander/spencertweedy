- Dad’s birthday!
- A 1AM leftover seafood grazing session in the kitchen, attended by Sammy, Mom, and me.
- [The Durutti Column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsM_L_R9Th4){: .music}! (I first heard “Belgian Friends" a zillion years ago on the Late Night Tales MGMT compilation. It popped into my head a few times since then but I never knew what it was or if I had even really heard it. So hearing it again was a relief in a way I didn't even know my mind wanted.)
