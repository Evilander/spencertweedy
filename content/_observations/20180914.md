- Watching construction workers pour concrete into a huge building foundation from our hotel room across the street.
- The beautiful, illustrated graphic tee… with Papyrus type at the bottom.
- The rideshare driver waiting for his passengers while drumming on his steering wheel with real drumsticks.
- Attending a Wisconsin wedding.
	- The Donald Trump Jr. lookalike.
	- Among older couples, the husbands struggling to keep up with their wives on the dance floor.
	- How some people are *really* in their element at wedding parties.
	- Overhearing a guy talking about alternating between driving his normal car and his Tesla. *”You gotta alternate.”*
	- Getting punched in the gut—playfully, but hard—by the bride.
