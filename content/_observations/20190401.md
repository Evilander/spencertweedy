- Taking Basil to the vet to address his popped boil pimple thing [[3-31-19](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/033119.html)]. (It was a reaction to his flu shot, for which the vaccine manufacturer is expected to compensate Casey. He went home with a cone and some medicine. Heâ€™s coping like a good boy.)
- Buying a light bulb for my car and getting talked into buying *bulb grease* along with it.
