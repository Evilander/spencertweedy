- The park district employee who noticed me struggling to re-secure a fence that I had opened for him and came back to help me with it.
- A red balloon!!!!
- The stage assemblers grunting with every lift, feeling it but also almost certainly exaggerating. Sounding like (they want to be) a pirate crew.
- The signage material that smells like really bad ramen and sweat. The truck full of porta-potties that went by and smelled better than the signage material.
