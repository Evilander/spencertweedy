- Casey apologizing to flowers before cutting their stems.
- Complimenting two separate guitar pick guards.
- The sound of multiple window AC units on an Elston Avenue apartment building.
- Watching a woman walk into a red-light crosswalk with a kid in a stroller.
- The blue CPAP-looking hose in the alley by Casey’s.
- The huge line of firecrackers inching along the park sidewalk.
- Yet more confirmation that I look like the Report of the Week guy, this time from a stranger’s tweet.
