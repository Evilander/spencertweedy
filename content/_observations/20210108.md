- The *permanence* of Tr\*mp’s Twitter ban is what makes it feel relieving. A temporary suspension, yet another “You better get your act together!” slap on the wrist, would have felt like authorities *still* don’t understand the threat.
- Watching interviews of Capitol insurrectionists, feeling disturbed about how they *think* they’re helping. It’s one thing to cope with and understand people who are trying to harm; it’s another to cope with people who harm while claiming they want to help. (Of course, I don’t believe their intentions are really so good. But even the lip service they pay to a helping spirit is disturbing.)
