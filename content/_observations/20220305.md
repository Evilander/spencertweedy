- Sammy’s and my first synth-and-drums duo show ever, at True/False Film Festival’s “Sanctuary” stage in the First Presbyterian Church in Columbia, Missouri. It felt great!
	- The sound engineer’s 3D-printed drum mic enclosures.
- *[Mija](https://www.sundance.org/blogs/festival-blog/mija-premiere/)*. Doris’s dad! It is worth seeing this documentary not only for the story but also because Doris’s dad’s love for his family, his selflessness and gentleness, is an antidote to the pessimism and disappointment that years of national friction and insensitivity can instill in us.
- The two splotches of water on the floor outside the hotel elevator. Wondering how they got there. Then, a few minutes later, seeing a kid gingerly carrying two cups of water toward the elevator — second attempt.
