- George Saunders in his latest [newsletter](https://www.georgesaundersbooks.com/newsletter): “I’m not sure how much this is worth, but I keep thinking that our real issue is a moral-ethical one, and an educational one. We don’t know enough about where we came from and are losing our basic respect for truth. We’re under siege from our own technology, which is eating away at our ability to be comfortable with ambiguity and nuance. What I’m going to commit to, no matter what, is to continue to try to get smarter and kinder and less slothful. And I’m going to continue to believe that the great secret weapon we’ve been given (and have, culturally, been neglecting) is literature—the best means humans have ever discovered for true transformation.”
