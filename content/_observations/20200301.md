- More moving help at 20th Century TV & Stereo [[2-24-20](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/20200224/)].
	- The sound of plastic stereo and VCR parts jiggling in my car trunk.
	- The customer who came in, acting like a jerk, demanding a refund, and then if not a refund, contrition from the owners. “You probably think I’m an asshole,” he said to me, mostly correctly. (It ended well, thanks to fellow helper Andy.)
	- The polka records and homemade Lawrence Welk tapes strewn around.
	- At their new store, the storefront church congregation singing next door.
- The stranger who held open the door for me, beleaguered by multiple pizza boxes, at Lou Malnati’s.
- The orange latex glove on the ground.
