- A wonderful, joyous birthday in Austin, Texas, led by Liam through a mini tour of a few great meals, aided by Lane, culminating in a fun show at The Mohawk.
	- Veracruz Tacos. Worth the hype. Perhaps the best I’ve ever had.
	- The bats squeaking beneath the famous bat bridge, heard but not seen.
	- The beautiful 1969 Fannie Davis Gazebo along the river.
	- Eating brisket — tasting smoke and fat — for the first time in many years, feeling so grateful and sated, savoring every bite.

At last, in 2023, I want to tell the tech CEOs and venture capitalists: pipe down. Buzz off. Go fave each other’s tweets.”
