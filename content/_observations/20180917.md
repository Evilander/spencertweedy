- The mosquitos, who never really came in full force this summer, coming back with a vengeance.
	- How they penetrated my innermost sanctum: my drum booth.
- The crack in the toilet bowl that looks exactly like a smooshed/fossilized dragonfly.
- The weird combination of ‘80s dance sounds and high-passed, tinny electric guitar on Prince’s *Dirty Mind* (thanks Ridley).
- Learning about the difference between “hermeneutics of faith” and “hermeneutics of suspicion” and thinking that both concepts can apply to dealing with trolls/politics. Then, the phrase: “ya gotta get hermeneutic on their asses.”
