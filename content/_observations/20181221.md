- Vini Lopez’s funky, energetic drumming on *Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.* blowing my mind (via Casey).
- Drumming with Leonora, the baby of my friend and pseudo-sister Liz.
- Wondering about psychosomaticism: At some point doesn’t our cognition get better than our body’s physical knowledge of what’s going on? e.g. Our bodies retain more fat when they “expect” that we’ll have little access to food in the future (based on recent relatively low intake), but since we’re now better able to consciously predict how much access to food we’ll have, why can’t our bodies respond to *that* info instead of the gut’s crude predictive mechanism?
