- The packing styrofoam caught beneath a fence like the Wicked Witch’s legs.
- Someone asking *me* for advice in Home Depot, a lifetime first.
	- “You look like you know more about contracting than I do,” he said, because I was wearing a brown jacket.
- A special night at Casey’s and my favorite neighborhood bar, on what happened to be Open Mic Night.
	- The duo that brought their own smoke machine and performed in light-up electronic masks.
	- The super friendly harmonica player who explained to us “I’m a slut for music. I’m a jammer.”
	- The drummer waiting play, drumming on every possible surface — bar stool, bar top, self — in the meantime, breaking drummer etiquette.
	- An audience member’s impassioned flamenco dance stomps shaking the whole bar.
