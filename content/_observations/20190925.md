- Cleaning cob webs off the house by wrapping them around a garden shovel like cotton candy.
- The treadmill in the middle of a fluorescent-lit apartmentâ€™s living room.

- Seasonal Affective Disorder may be setting in, but at least the earlier sunsets make automatic Dark Mode turn on more quickly.
