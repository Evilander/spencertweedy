- Reading in the park at Casey’s and Basil’s side.
	- [Russell on Sparta](https://bookshop.org/a/10169/9780671201586){: .prose}. I think the thing that draws so many authoritarian dweebs to the myth of Sparta is their fear of pain. It’s appealing to think that one could be trained from birth to tolerate discomfort. If you were raised that way, they subconsciously suppose, life now would be so much easier. *I would be numb, superhuman even.* But as Russell points out, their desire to be insulated from pain is a bad reason to subject others to austerity. And do you really want to grow up sleeping on straw mats with thistles in them?
- The tension and collaboration of Abbie Hoffman and Tom Hayden as depicted in *The Trial of the Chicago 7*. Two very different visions of activism, each potent and beautiful in their own way, even more potent together.
- The music in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUuLmFdpuo){: .music} about installing drywall.
