- Witnessing an apparent CBD oil deal go down between two older men in the campus center.
- The plastic dinosaur resting in a bowl on the counter in our kitchen, and the sign one of my housemates had written for it: “Please don't move me, I'm growing.”
- How much 1972 J.J. Cale sounds like present-day Bob Dylan on *Naturally*.
- Wondering whether architects are pissed when owners put bad additions on buildings they designed.
