- A hearse driving by at the same time as a car with a booming, bassy stereo, and me, imagining that the music was coming from the hearse instead of the car.
- Learning about (and using) the “crow’s foot” measurement marking method of carpentry.
- Eating little BelGioioso mozzarella cheese balls for the first time since the betrayal [9-13-18].
- A professor saying “diven” instead of “dove” for the past tense of “dive.”
- Wanting to learn more about how vitamins in energy drinks make us feel more energetic.
- The moral dilemma between feeling like I should markup books (as all good readers do) and wanting to give a fresh copy to the used book store when I sell/donate it later, especially in used books that *I* bought without any markup in them. Using Post-it notes in the meantime.
- The conventional wisdom that tells us we should make it as easy as possible to do the creative work we want to do—e.g. put a guitar next to the bed, keep a notebook on the nightstand—in conflict with the poisonous thought that if you do anything to make your creative work easier, it’s a sign of a lack of determination or passion. Deciding, pretty confidently, that the latter thought is misguided, because making your environment more hospitable to work *is* an act of determination, evidence of your passion. Why should caring about your creative work mean that you should make it harder for yourself to do it?
