- Going back to college to walk in our commencement ceremony.
	- The plastic ponchos administrators distributed to grads for the rain, and the dissident students who refused them.
	- The professor riding her bike in full academic regalia, sidesaddle, to meet up with the faculty procession.
	- The mom who ran ahead of the grads to wipe rainwater off our plastic folding chairs with a handkerchief.
	- Lee Shallat-Chemel’s awesome commencement address.
		- Describing her life as a “squiggly line,” giving us permission to be inefficient.
		- Telling the “don’t be afraid of failure” story in the least clichéd terms I’ve ever heard it, illustrating her life as an excessively careful, anxious twentysomething, and how hyper-vigilance can extinguish creativity.
