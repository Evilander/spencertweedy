- Playing with Kelly Hogan (with Nora O’Connor and Joel Paterson!), opening for Mavis Staples, at Thalia Hall.
	- Mavis was so energetic and so hilarious on stage, even more than usual.
- The respect I have for venues’ in-house lighting directors, who pay attention and instantly adapt to music they’ve never heard before.
