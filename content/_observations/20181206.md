- My first *Elf* movie sighting of winter ‘18-‘19, at a toy store.
- Wondering about the etymology of “salad days.” (I had always thought it came from *Raising Arizona*, a scriptural document in my family.) [12-22-18: Apparently it's Shakespearean.]
- British people soothing America with their biscuits via *The Great British Baking Show*.
