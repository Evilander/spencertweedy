- Band walk through beautiful Laurelhurst Park in Portland, Oregon.
- Recording three songs with [Scott McCaughey](https://scottthehoople.bandcamp.com/){: .music}! Semi-impromptu.
- Pizza with Gil and Nicole Divine of [Divine Noise](https://www.thedivinenoise.com/divine/pages/about)!
- This [harrowing report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/11/20/king-county-seattle-homeless-pandemic-/) on the state of mental health crisis response in Seattle.
- This [thought-provoking, even beautiful report](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/a-french-villages-radical-vision-of-a-good-life-with-alzheimers) on alternative Alzheimer’s care in France.
- The [Xerox bug](https://www.dkriesel.com/en/blog/2013/0802_xerox-workcentres_are_switching_written_numbers_when_scanning) that replaced numbers in photocopies for years before being detected and patched. I file this under “something to remember when evaluating explanations for some unexpected result.” The super unlikely explanation isn’t always wrong!
