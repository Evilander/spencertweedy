- Tussling with Hayden and Miron’s puppies at the farm.
- Remembering when gas stations prohibited cell phone use because something about static electricity from their antennae could cause fires?
- The only thing better than Wilc-os cereal is the new Wilco album, out May 27.
- “[Concrete over Water](https://jockstrapmusic.bandcamp.com/track/concrete-over-water){: .music}” by Jockstrap.
