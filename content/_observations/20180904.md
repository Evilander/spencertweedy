- The construction workers who set up a block-long, yellow plastic tube on the sidewalk in front of the studio door and driveway, elevated on little stands every few yards.
- The warning lights blinking on my dashboard, more numerous and varied than I’d ever seen at the same time before.
	- Thinking the car might explode and I might die.
	- Realizing that, when we think “I might die,” it’s not necessarily because we think it’s *probable*, but just because we’d rather not be caught off guard by it. Just in case.
	- Calling a roadside assistance number and talking to a representative who sounded like a very young kid, hesitant about every question (“Um… Do you have, um, a V… a VIN?”). :(
	- Politely hanging up and googling the problem to find out it was a rain-soaked wire. The warning lights turned off when the wire dried out.
- Resting a kick drum microphone on a pillow and imagining that we were making it comfortable or tucking it into bed.
- Moving all of the gear for a session (drums, keyboards, mics) to one house, then back into my basement across town for better acoustics.
- Watching Crazy Rich Asians with Casey. Going into it with an open mind and coming away happy with the multidimensionality of the characters and the not-totally-Hollywood story.
- Waking up from a nap with the phrases “stank you” and “stankrifice” in my head.
