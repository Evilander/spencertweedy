- My disdain for sugary Yoplait yogurt.
- The monster *Wait But Why* post about Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain-machine interface company that wants to give us the intellectual abilities of AI so we’re better able to defend ourselves against robots in the future.
- Watching ice cubes melt in a hot water kettle.
- Tatsu Ramen in LA’s adorable website and neon sign and great ramen.
