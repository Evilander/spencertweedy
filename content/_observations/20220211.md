- Comforting to hear for a multidisciplinarian, from [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://world.hey.com/dhh/i-won-t-let-you-pay-me-for-my-open-source-d7cf4568): “You don’t just have a fixed pie of productivity to divide amongst your pursuits […] The pie expands and shrinks depending on your motivation and your mood. When one area of your life is contracting, it often shrinks all the other areas along with it. And when one part of your life is expanding, others often follow too.”
	- His phrase “Malthusian specter,” stuck in my head.
