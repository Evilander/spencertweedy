- Day two of Solid Sound. Playing with Liam to a super sweet, packed audience, the first show of the day. Lawrence Azerrad and me hosting the first in-person event for *Mirror Sound*, which came out in 2020: a self-recording demo with Sam Evian and Liam. One of Sammyâ€™s first solo electronic shows ever, a pop-up inside the museum.
