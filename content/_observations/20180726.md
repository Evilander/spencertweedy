- The badass, tiny, older white lady, crossing the street and stopping traffic with her cart, wearing pink shorts and a big sun hat, enthusiastically waving *thank you* at the cars she stopped.
- Her moon, the overweight, bearded white dude with stains on his shirt, wheeling a cart with three thirty-racks of Busch Lite and Little Debbie’s snacks in it.
- The construction worker whose beard looked dyed black, repairing a sidewalk seemingly by himself, throwing two-by-fours off of a tilted dump truck and grimacing.
- The dental surgeon’s office.
	- The moody lighting in the waiting room.
	- The nauseating, textured, brown vortex commercial painting in the x-ray room.
	- Accidentally insinuating that my mom might not want to call the administrator because she was black?
- The shirtless biker wearing a bandana, looking exactly like David Foster Wallace.
- The way digital highway signs emulate the physical ones.
- My underwear, from the batch I bought at H&M in Canada when I forgot mine at home on a Blisters tour, working in tandem with my pants to make it hard to play the drum beat I was playing.
- The four-dollar Indian food from Devon, spicier than I bargained for, making me think I was gonna puke.
- The guy at the bar, smiling all night, happening to use a wheelchair, ogling girls' butts.
