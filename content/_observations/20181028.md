- Adding text shortcuts for “i.e.” and “e.g.” to my iPhone settings.
- Finally making progress on an essay I've tried to write in different academic contexts for the past four years. I started it as a personal essay in high school and since then I've turned it into a presentation in a class about American Pragmatism and a full-blown independent study project, but it didn't really click until I pared it down this weekend. [Update 11-1-18: The celebration was maybe premature, because it feels murky again. But I'm still workin' on it.]
