- Buying a lightbulb, a washboard, and a plunger at CAS Hardware, a neighborhood hardware store going out of business after 41 years.
	- The brightly colored packaging and amazing typography on all the new old stock in its aisles.
- Putting a hat on a pile of clothes and worrying that the pile would come aliveâ€¦ because I put a hat on it.
