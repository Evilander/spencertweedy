- The free jazz musician playing a tuba resonator by blowing on a latex glove stretched over its smaller opening.
	- The same musician making that awful, squeaky styrofoam sound (on purpose), the first time I’ve been angry at improvised music.
- Going to a “chihuahua party” fundraiser for a local pet shelter with Casey, at which Basil was conspicuously one of the only chihuahuas in attendance.
- How all six varieties of crackers in the Whole Food Entertainment Cracker pack have different, exquisite tastes, including one that tastes like soup.
