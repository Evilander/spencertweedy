- The poodle with red painted nails at security at LAX.
- Remembering that the goal isn’t to hoard everything you have, but instead to spend it at a reasonable rate.
- Meeting Casey’s perfect new dog, Basil.
- Relocating a beetle from the bathroom wall to the basement garage, a move that upset my mom (does not want beetles in basement) but which technically satisfied her request of removing the beetle from the bathroom.
