- Attending my first-ever White Sox game, with my uncle Paul.
	- The beer vendor who used the condensation from a can to wet his hands and then, with his hands, his hair.
	- The verdict of the “are hot dogs sandwiches?” debate, settled by an old-school White Sox concessions employee speaking to my uncle: “Sorry, honey, no hot dog sandwiches here.”
