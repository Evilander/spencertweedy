- Going to a family-owned little hardware store for keys, lightbulbs, heat-shrink tubing.
	- The cool, weird things they stock.
	- Having more fun (and spending less) than I would have in a Home Depot.
- Witnessing two separate arrests on the street.
- One of my least favorite things in the world: the white reggae-fication of “The Weight” by the Band.
