- How if you *really* believed in American spirit of ingenuity, you wouldn’t be afraid of universal basic income (or other poverty alleviation measures), because you’d trust that people are motivated to *innovate* and *explore* and *expand the frontier* by an internal drive, not by the fear of losing healthcare or housing or food.
- Awaiting the inauguration with a hearty mix of fear and excitement.
- How fun it is to find rhymes you *mean*, rather than rhymes for rhymes’ sake.
