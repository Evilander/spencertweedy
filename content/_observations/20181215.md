- How nice it is, still, that San Francisco didn’t get rid of its trolleys in a knee jerk for the future.
- Waiting in line, like the tourists Casey and I are, for bubble tea at Boba Guys.
- The drummer in the cocktail band at Casey’s company’s holiday party with a mini tambourine attached to his shoe.
- How even with little familiarity of his work (I’ve watched a few episodes of *Parts Unknown* and read and loved *Kitchen Confidential*), I have denial about Anthony Bourdain’s death. Not really about its reality, but about its being suicide. Some part of me assumes, or wants to believe, that it was pharmaceutically influenced or accidental.
- The internet-controlled RobotStreamer[.]com RC car wandering the street (with a human overseer).
