- Casey and me replacing the lightbulbs in a fixture in our rented cabin with warmer ones because we’re light connoisseurs.
- The moss on the roof of the cabin next door.
- Walking on a frozen lake with Casey and, separately, Basil in a doggie backpack.
- Taking my pumpkin pie fate into my own hands — finally eating some after a holiday season without any.
