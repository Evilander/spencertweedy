- Watching a student come into the campus center, walk over to a couch, and immediately lie down sideways on it, backpack on and all.
- The classic car show on the street in front of our campus, and some of their older owners, sitting silently in the driver's seats.
- The instructor of the Balinese gamelan ensemble [9-26-18] pronouncing â€œSpencer" like "Princess."
- Getting a really, really sweet check-in text from another friend [9-27-18].
- Songs from a cover band at Oktoberfest floating across town and onto campus.
