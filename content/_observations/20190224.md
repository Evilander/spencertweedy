- Watching a two-hour *Bozo’s Circus* retrospective with my parents.
	- The hellish footage of circus poodles wearing Victorian dresses, getting married, and marching to the *Star-Spangled Banner*.
	- Bozo and co. imitating The Beatles with a super rare National guitar.
- Learning, maybe a little too late, that there’s a difference between “picturesque” and “picaresque.”
