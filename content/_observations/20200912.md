- The oxygen thingies (nasal cannulae) hanging from the rearview mirror of a Jeep idling in the auto shop parking lot.
- Watching _Parasite_ with Casey. Soo beautiful, sad, intense.
- The misinformed comments on my post about supporting [Illinoisâ€™ Fair Tax amendment](https://www.yesforfairtax.org/){: .pol}, which will slightly cut taxes for everyone earning less than $250,000 and slightly raise them for everyone earning more than that, generating $3 billion per year for schools and healthcare. Ad campaigns funded by super-wealthy Illinoisans are so effective that even working people think an effort to make taxes fairer is somehow out to get them. It stinks.
