- Breaking my key off in the studio door.
- The Geraldo Rivera lookalike, wearing a black button-up (chest visible), ribcage-height jeans, and Skechers-ass sneakers.
- That crazy, new Holger Czukay retrospective box set (thanks Billy).
- The fence painted with “fallen soldier” silhouette art, then the pickup truck with “fallen soldier” window art.
- The parking garage door with a little pedestrian door in it, like an industrial version of a hobbit home.
- Walking down a not-moving escalator.
- The strobing building lights.
- The strobing license plate light.
- The automatic sprinklers watering the DMV lawn.
- “Lake Shore Drive” by Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah poking through the bagel shop radio.
