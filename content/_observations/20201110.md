- Basil barking at the painting of the *Star Wars* (album) cat.
- The blurry neon colors in the rainy car backup camera feed.
- The [field recordings](http://quietamerican.org/field_vietnam.html){: .music} by Quiet American, including [this one](http://www.quietamerican.org/download/sources-vietnam/Hmong.mp3) of Hmong musicians (beware, autoplay) in Vietnam in 1998 (via Alan Jacobsâ€™ newsletter).
- The [incredible sorta photo, sorta rendering](http://www.digizyme.com/cst_landscapes.html) of the inside of a eukaryotic cell. If you were alive in 100 CE, 1800 CE, even 1950 CE, do you think you ever would have imagined we could look inside our bodies this way?
