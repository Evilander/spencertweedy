- The frozen tree branches clinking.
- How the books were installed in the new library on the North Side before the building was even finished. (It was heartening.)
	- Who picked the books?
- Every few months, getting a message from a student in an Eastern European country whose textbook uses my face as an example of a teenaged American blogger. Sometimes these pictures come with no context.
