- Biking around the extended neighborhood, looking for an affordable studio space to buy or rent.
- Stopping in a 7Eleven parking lot where a group of teens in a car teased their friend twirling a sign for Little Caesar’s: “Twirl that sign!” (Any time teens yell something out of a car I feel like I’m in the 1950s.)
- Dad’s iPhone photo shoot with a frog he found, Cecil.
