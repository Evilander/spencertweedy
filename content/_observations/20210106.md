- Chuck Schumer thanking police for returning the Capitol to its “rightful owners” after the attempted insurrection of the afternoon. At first, that struck me as weird, since congresspeople aren’t the “rightful owners” of that building; the People are. But in that congresspeople are the People’s representatives, and the insurrectionists are no one’s representatives but their own, the Capitol *was* returned to its rightful owners. The insurrectionists don’t get to speak for all of us. They don’t get to selfishly seize the government or any symbol of it. If they reflected on America and weren’t blinded by racist anger, they’d see that.
