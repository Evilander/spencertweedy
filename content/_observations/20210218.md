- The tiny, dense, but inactive spider nests inside of my car’s tail light assembly.
- Carefully jacking up our sagging studio ceiling with a bottle jack and a floor post.
- The passing of Akron/Family’s Miles Seaton, writer of one of my favorite songs ever: “[I’ll Be on the Water](https://akronfamily.bandcamp.com/track/ill-be-on-the-water){: .music}.”
- Basil momentarily sinking into the deep snow.
