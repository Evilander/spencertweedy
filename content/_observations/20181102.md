- Noticing that a sweet but sorta obnoxious classmate keeps the Queen of England as his iPhone background, maybe unironically.
- The Balinese pea and jackfruit soup our gamelan instructor made for the class.
	- Its smell mixing with the smells of our socks/feet.
	- Watching videos of massive Balinese funeral pyres and weddings while we enjoyed it together.
	- After the soup break, accidentally stepping over one of the instruments, which is looked down upon in Bali because it shows the soles of your feet to the instrument. I hadn't learned about that but I was embarrassed anyway.
- The distant sound of students sing-yelling "Don't Stop Believin'" in another dorm building. Again [10-27-18].
