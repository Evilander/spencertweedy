- Taking pleasure in deleting the morning alarm I've kept on my phone since high school.
- The house with approximately one gajillion blow-up Christmas decorations in its yard.
- How the tip jar at my neighborhood's pizza place is a hole in the cashier's desk with an arrow sign pointing down into it.
