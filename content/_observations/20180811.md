- Recording more songs with my Skip Spence-y friend (8-9-18), getting blasted by a loud burp through the vocal mic into my headphones.
- My nine-year-old cousin reciting “Do Your Ears Hang Low?” and “Für Elise” on piano, playing guitar along with him.
- Standing in a cardboard box and feeling surprisingly comforted by it.
- Eating noodle kugel while driving.
- The subtle, editorial taste that pokes through on Vine compilations.
