- Our anti-Bibi, progressive Passover seder.
	- Biting off more horseradish (*maror*) than I could comfortably take; my face turning red.
	- My cousin’s iPhone wallpaper: a still from Jim Carrey’s *The Mask*.
- The driver of a Lyft I took to Lincoln Hall:
	- “You’re one of the good Jews” (paraphrased).
	- A story about his friend who, while in prison, planned to kill the warden upon his release, but decided against it, because…
	- “Forgiveness is the most powerful weapon.”
- The man watching a video on his phone—loudly—during Steve Gunn’s set at Lincoln Hall.
- Advice from a real estate agent at the Steve Gunn show: “Don’t care about money. Be a musician.”
- The Escalade with a painting of *itself* on its trunk gate.
