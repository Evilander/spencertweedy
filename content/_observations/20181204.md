- It being the season where I reply to emails before they turn one year old.
- The dollhouse-sized menorahs for sale on Amazon ($124 with free shipping!).
- Waiting for someone to propose a conspiracy theory about Grammarly, that spell- and grammar-check app (e.g. that itâ€™s a CIA/NSA data harvesting scheme?!).
