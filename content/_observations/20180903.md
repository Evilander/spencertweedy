- The wiener dog in a stroller at Target.
- The graffiti on the sign for the Kimball Avenue highway exit, and how hard it must have been to get it up there.
- Double- and triple-checking the artist title in iTunes after putting on Palm’s new metal record.
- Revisiting Fruit Bats (“The Ruminant Band” and “You’re Too Weird”).
- The hammered couple giving/receiving a lap dance a few seats down from Casey and me at the bar, and us, commiserating with the bartenders about it.
