- Playing Cayamo Cruise while the ship pitched and rolled! Feeling like if it rolled any farther, our amps and drums would fall over.
	- Getting ready for our Cayamo show in a dressing room near the upper tip of the ship, one of the rolliest points.
	- Serendipitously farting the exact same note that a trumpeter had just played outside our dressing room door.
