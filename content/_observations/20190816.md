- Buying a reach-in cooler off Facebook Marketplace from a mother and daughter in Wisconsin. Their living room, absolutely full of Packers memorabilia. And, when we needed a piece of duct tape, the immediacy with which the mother was able to procure it. As if in a holster on her belt.
- George Jones records reverberating through Avrom Farmâ€™s field at night.
