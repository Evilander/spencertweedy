- Peering down at the bottom of a clear Lake Michigan.
- The sea of sun umbrellas as seen from a paddleboard a couple hundred feet out.
- Paddling up to a buoy to discover it was actually a red balloon, partially deflated, sitting on the lake surface.
- The families wading in the murky creek water.
- Basil chasing a big blue heron out of a pond.
