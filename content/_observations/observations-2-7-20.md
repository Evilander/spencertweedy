- Walking around St. John’s in Antigua while the cruise ship [2-3-20](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/20200203/) docked.
	- The display of burned CD-R gospel records for sale on the street.
	- The pickup truck bed piled high with *huge* stuffed animals.
	- Walking into a dilapidated cricket stadium and finding a whole school of kids having recess in the bleachers, listening to “Stanky Legg” over the loudspeakers.
	- The people whose job it is to sit on the little concrete platforms in the middle of the port to attach and detach ships’ anchor ropes. The rowboats waiting next to them.
- In the elevator on the cruise ship, watching a festival attendee give a handful of (unsolicited) mushrooms to an artist before the doors closed.
