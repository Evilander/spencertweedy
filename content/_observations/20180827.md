- Accidentally looking directly into the flash of a camera.
	- The orange Strobies logo.
- The parent who had clipped a big, plastic portable fan on to her baby’s car seat carrier.
- The planetarium.
	- Museum smell.
	- The flickering of the plastic planets in a solar system display.
- The flyers, *everywhere* on the North Side of Chicago right now, advertising “$1500 CUSTOM WEBSITE,” from Edgewater to the Loop.
- The Korean spa.
	- The laminated signs above masseuses’ stations: “ANDY,” “JAKE,” “DANNY.”
	- The wooden foot rests with wood-burned, script warnings: “Don’t take it.”
	- The blood vessels in my butt cheeks pulsing after sitting on a sauna floor.
	- Eating hard-boiled eggs cooked in a fire sudatorium.
	- The video of a chef cutting beef with scissors.
	- Talking about a smell with Sammy, referring to it as part of “the smelltrack of our lives.” (I’m proud of that one.)
	- The miniature staircase leading up to the dumpster outside.
- My discomfort with the word “last” (as in “last decade” or “last work”) since it can be taken to mean “final” instead of “most recent.”
- Learning that Marimekko is a Finnish brand, not the name of a single Japanese designer.
- Wondering whether the temperature of water affects plants when they slurp it up.
- How the leaves have started falling already.
