- On our way back to Chicago from Columbia, seeing a bald eagle get hit by a car. It was grazing on roadkill with some vultures when a car approached them in the lane opposite us. The vultures flew away, but the eagle was slow to launch because it’s so big. By the time it had lifted off the car was too close and clipped its wing; it spiraled out to the ground. Casey and I were horrified.
	- We pulled over to figure out how to help, and moments later a young sheriff happened to drive by. He took a look at the eagle, thought it was dead, but assured us (convincingly) he would drive up the hill to get cell service and call a wildlife org. (Why he couldn’t radio dispatch to call, I wasn’t sure.)
	- It was disturbing to see because all violence is disturbing, but also because the eagle is so huge and beautiful. It’s also hard to divorce the way you feel about a bald eagle from their status in our culture. Their status feels deserved.
