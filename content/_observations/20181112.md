- Playing on Colbert (!).
	- The commemorative plaque on the reinforcement columns in the basement, which were put there before circus elephants appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1956.
	- Going full Uniqlo Canadian tuxedo.
	- Hopefully redeeming myself from the tantrum I threw ~17 years ago (age ~5) because Wilco was on David Letterman and I was too young to stay for the taping.
	- The NYPD cop ordering our *one* lonely fan outside the stage door (after Hugh Jackman's gaggle had dispersed) to wait for us on the other side of the street, motioning about her to me as if to say, *This crazy lady!* And us, walking over to the other side of the street to meet her.
	- Watching our segment of the show at a bar in Brooklyn, where they don't normally turn the TV on, but where they did—with volume—because our friend Sam called ahead. :)
- Touring Sear Sound (!) with Tom and Sammy. Meeting Roberta.
