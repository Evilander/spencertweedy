- Mom inspecting the Case Oats tour van before we headed out for the band’s first run.
- The Dubuque, Iowa chamber of commerce members in matching red smoking jackets, cocktails in hand, who held a ribbon cutting ceremony (complete with novelty scissors) at the Fox Den Motel’s new live music room during the Case Oats soundcheck.
- The bartender who told us she had never tended bar before; she’s usually a farmer.
