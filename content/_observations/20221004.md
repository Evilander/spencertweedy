- “[Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/)” by Donella Meadows: “Leverage points are not intuitive. Or if they are, we intuitively use them backward, systematically worsening whatever problems we are trying to solve.” Fascinating terminology and concepts in that article. I’m interested in learning more about "systems analysis.”
