- The smoldering pile of compost in a lot along the river.
- Seeing the price change on a gas station's LED sign.
- The highway worker picking up a dead owl. :(
- How soldiers repurpose/improvise with their officially issued tools and clothes in the field. That has always been interesting to me… how creativity infects a seemingly rigid and DoD-managed world.
- Waiting for another album from Michael Cera.
- The new *White Album* mixes by Giles Martin.
	- Approaching them with some cynicism but being pleasantly surprised. They sound cool. I'm glad they're presented as an addition and not a replacement for the originals. My biggest complaint is I miss a little hiss.
	- Noticing the skronk guitar on "Dear Prudence" for the first time.
	- However annoying “Ob-La-Di" is, it's an amazing aural painting.
