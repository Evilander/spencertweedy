- On the road from Chicago to Austin, Texas, stopping for the night in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
	- Eating lunch from Crown Candy in St. Louis, a beautiful, old-school malt shop.
	- The old brick homes surrounding the store, some of which are vacant but still stunning and regal, some of which are lovingly maintained.
