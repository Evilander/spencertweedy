- The building with a grate in the roof to allow an existing tree’s branches to grow through it.
- The trees with Seussian drooping branches.
- Shopping with Mom at a Goodwill off Route 66 in front of a hulking mountain.
- Getting spicy brown mustard in a wound in my finger.
- The friendly “hiker helper” woman, Debbie, picking us up on the road to a trailhead, telling us about how stupid and troublesome other hikers are. She reminded me of Amy Sedaris in *Mandelorian*. At one point she slowed the car, leaned out the window and told a confused hiker, “There! The trail’s right next to you! Go!”
