- *[Love Is The King](https://jefftweedy.bandcamp.com/album/love-is-the-king){: .music}* sitting next to Harry Styles on the Billboard vinyl chart (and at number one on the indie music chart). 😱
- Loving Ludwig’s new reproduction of their legendary Speed King kick drum pedal.
- My neighbor Irwin’s advice to me about our newly purchased table saw: “Never lose your fear of it.”
- Thoughts on the GameStop stock craze (rules of thumb, and also I’m not a financial advisor):
	- 1. Don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose.
	- 2. Don’t buy high unless you can *really* reasonably expect it to rise even higher.
	- 3. Don’t put too many eggs in one basket — a diversified portfolio is much safer.
	- Bonus: Tradable shares should probably be abolished. It would do a lot to make the economy more efficient and more accessible to everyone. See *[Another Now](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/9781847925633?gC=098f6bcd4){: .prose}* by Yanis Varoufakis.
