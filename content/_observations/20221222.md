- Dad in [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/music-and-mental-health/): “There’s no way to overestimate the benefit that universal healthcare would have for everybody … This is an obscene stress to put on peoples’ lives: not just the worry of getting sick, but the worry of going bankrupt because you’re sick, and the denial of even taking care of yourself or getting checked if you’re sick, which grows out of that fear. It’s a totally dysfunctional way of living.”
