- Stumbling upon, and feeling thankful all over again, for [Marianne’s kind post](https://www.popthomology.com/2011/04/dont-be-square-buy-spencer-tweedys-book.html) about my 2011 photo book.
- The [Wilson Trailer logo](https://www.google.com/search?q=wilson+trailer+logo).
- The concept of [Rip Medical Debt](https://ripmedicaldebt.org/) is interesting and to the extent it works, I admire the people organizing it, but we need the full cure (universal healthcare) in addition to the Band-Aid (debt relief).
- Annie Rauwerda, AKA Depths of Wikipedia: “[I’m all about cutting open the bean](https://open.substack.com/pub/deeep/p/going-deep-with-depths-of-wikipedias?r=62534&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web){: .prose}.”
- Laurel Schwulst of Firefly Sanctuary: “I've had a dream to have some kind of ambient notification in both the physical and digital spaces [of Firefly Sanctuary] to allow for more cross-pollination of presence. For example, maybe a light shows up in the corner of the apartment to indicate that someone is on the website, or a light in the corner of the website to indicate that someone is physically in the apartment.” [Cool](https://open.substack.com/pub/deeep/p/a-website-is-a-sanctuary?r=62534&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)!
	- Laurel’s notion of “find the others” adding to my motivation to write about my life again, to cut through the “this is narcissistic” barrier.
