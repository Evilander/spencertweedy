- Twitter user @KT\_So\_It\_Goes reminding everybody that protest is patriotic, that working to make the country safer and fairer for everybody isn’t counter to the Constitution; it’s one of the best expressions of its ideals:
	- “[the Founding Fathers] weren’t perfect … but the fact that we get to have this conversation at all is owed to those who tried to protect the people from the oppressive systems they knew too well. … the american idea is not a fixed condition and to treat it as such is anathema to the people who incepted it. … there is nothing more patriotic than demanding redress for a systemic injustice; there is nothing less patriotic than demanding the injustice stand because that’s the way it’s always been.”
