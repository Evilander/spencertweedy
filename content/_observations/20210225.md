- The sound of a nearby burglar-ish alarm giving way to birds chirping in the same register.
- The holes and cracks in the vacant mid-century office building lobby window.
- My shadow walking across the four-lane highway as I crossed the bridge overhead.
- Unknowingly pressing the speakerphone button moments before my mom burped into the phone, sending it straight into my ear.
