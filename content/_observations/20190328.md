- The relative innocence of left-wing rumors (e.g. Gun Girl pooped her pants, Chuck C. Johnson pooped his pants) versus right-wing conspiracy theories (e.g. all progressive protesters are paid by Jewish billionaires). (Is this confirmation bias?)
- Sammy and me getting outfitted in Big Bud Press jumpsuits by Mom.
	- Slightly regressing in my jumpsuit because it feels like footsie pajamas.
