- Mom insisting, “I’m a millennial.”
- Opening a salt packet with no salt in it.
- The Indiana literary/feminist history text decals on the window of the state-run rest stop. Appreciating the effort but judging the cheesy copy and bad typography.
	- The pretty blue-green rust/spill on the concrete.
	- Walking laps around the stop to stretch our legs.
	- The guy changing his bunny carriers’ litter in the parking lot.
- Listening to Jimmy Carter talk about housing as a basic human right on public radio.
- The small-town law offices of Spike Meckler.
- Vaguely misremembering the promotion for a TV special revealing the subject of Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain” (it was actually a memory of the promotion for her memoir in 2015).
- The moon, huge and orange behind clouds, getting higher and lower, bigger and smaller as we drove through the mountains.
- How I swear the bananas we brought on our road trip got brown since we left Chicago (less than 24 hours).
- Staying in the hippest cheap hotel with the most rambunctious lobby attendant. You would think coke was in play.
