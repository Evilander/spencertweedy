- The water passing underneath the frozen creek’s surface.
- The sticks encased in ice — popsicles.
- The waterfall flowing into a volcano mouth-esque ring of ice, which I imagine has built up over the whole course of winter, one water droplet freezing upon another.
- The meticulous phonetic accuracy of Jar Jar Binks’s subtitles in the Star Wars prequels.
- Stars seen through the little rectangular window in our rented cabin bedroom.
