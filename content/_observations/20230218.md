- Skywoman’s [OOLA tool](https://www.skywoman.community/tools): “A simple, free, must-have financial tool for anyone looking to start, overhaul, fine-tune, or evaluate alternatives to a regenerative pastured egg operation. You tell OOLA key elements about your operation: how many hens, land costs, cost of your supplies, etc. OOLA tells you how much money you need to get started, what it’ll cost to produce your eggs down to the doze, and how long it’ll take to recover your investment.”
