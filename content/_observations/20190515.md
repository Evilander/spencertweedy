- Thinking more about my late Grandpa Tweedy as the weather gets warmer, because a memorable part of my childhood was riding around in his hot car in Belleville (sticky leather, all that stuff), the smell of gasoline in his and Grandma’s dank garage, just generally sweating on visits to Southern Illinois.
- The guards of the Muslim community center playing with traffic safety batons like lightsabers.
- The blasphemy of using a sheet of Apple logo stickers as a bookmark while reading *Our Band Could Be Your Life*.
- Reaching the last dregs of the body wash and toothpaste I bought last fall—when I was starting my last year of college.
- Rodney A. Brooks explaining a feature of jellyfish neurons, which I took to be a cute, if not scientifically inapplicable, illustration of why drumming softly can be a good idea (via Edge.org; emphasis mine): “[Jellyfish] have a central clock generator, the signal gets distributed on the neurons, but there are different transmission times from the central clock to the different parts of the creature. So, how do they handle that? Well, different species handle it in different ways. Some use amazingly fast propagation. Others, because the spikes attenuate as they go a certain distance, there is a latency, which is inversely proportional to the signal strength. So, *the weaker the signal strength, the quicker you operate*, and that’s how the whole thing synchronizes.”
