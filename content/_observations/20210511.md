- The woman in front of me in line at the grocery store (unprompted), to me: “Don’t get married.”
- The guy pulling a grocery cart behind his bike, tipping it over as he tried to round a corner: “Fuck!”
- The thwack of hitting a baseball, as I remember it from the one or two times I made contact in little league batting practice.
- The suction of the car vacuum, unbearably loud, leaving my ears ringing.
