- First show of Liam Kazar on the West Coast. A lovely crowd at Sunset Tavern in Seattle. A lovely sound person, Ron. A lovely, Roxy Music-ish band on the bill, Fruit Juice. The bass player’s dog, Odin, ruling the roost from the stage as they played.
* Mark Miodownik in [The Prepared](https://theprepared.org/features-feed/stuff-matters): “There's a fundamental problem with self-repairing materials, which is that most of the incumbent industries don't want them. They don't want them for a very simple reason: they're making a lot of money at the moment with things that fall apart. They are really worried about self-repair, and roads are no different — there are a lot of roads and that's big money.”
* I like the [public bank and officer liability ideas](https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/11/30/chicagos-youngest-mayoral-hopeful-jamal-green-wants-cops-not-taxpayers-to-pay-for-police-misconduct/) put forward by Chicago mayoral candidate Jamal Green.
