- Running sound for a great children’s musician.
	- The miserable dad sitting at a table, pouting like a toddler.
	- The other dads’ asinine small talk.
	- The toddler audience behaving more rowdily than any audience I’ve seen here, bouncing a massive Earth globe beach ball around, crushing juice boxes.
- Jason Kunesh and team’s awesome, inclusive new visual design system for the City of Chicago.
