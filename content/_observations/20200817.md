- How helpful it is to have names for police’s brutal tactics. Like “kettling”: when police surround protesters so they can’t run for safety, and then beat them, often while announcing they’re required to leave the area at the same time. Politicians are calling protesters traitors and police are calling themselves victims, yet we consistently see that police are the main instigators of violence at protests. And names help us get that message across.
