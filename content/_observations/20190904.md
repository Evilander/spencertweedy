- The latex glove on the ground under a viaduct in Echo Park, LA.
- Feeling a little bit of the invincibility complex that’s typical of twenty-somethings creep into me sometimes. For example, when I’m afraid a stranger might hit me, I notice myself thinking, “I could take ‘em.” But I know I’d quickly find out I was wrong if something actually happened.
