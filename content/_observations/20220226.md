- Liam’s headlining show at Metro! Playing drums. Cadien (Lake James) debuting his great new music, and Wyatt Waddell singing Beatles songs (and a few originals) with thrilling prodigiousness, in sets before Liam’s. The tender moment of Andrew Sa applying Liam’s Lindsay Kemp-ish makeup on stage, while singing “[Something Tender](https://liamkazar.bandcamp.com/track/something-tender).” Casey's killer DJ set of soul records and other classics next door at Gman Tavern afterward.
