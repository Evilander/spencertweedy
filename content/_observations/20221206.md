- A day of chance dog encounters: sitting on a bench in Hayes Valley, San Francisco, getting friendlily ambushed by three leashless, pajama’d chihuahuas. Later, sitting in a park, a small gray scruffy dog issuing out a few dribbles of pee on my backpack before I had time to shoo it away, as its older owner sat obliviously nearby. Still cute though!
- Night 2 of The New Pornographers Liam Kazar at the Fillmore! Liam’s and my fifth show at the Fillmore this year.
