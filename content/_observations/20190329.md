- Releasing my second EP, [*Sleep Is My God*](https://spencertweedy.bandcamp.com/album/sleep-is-my-god).
	- The really nice feedback from family and friends and social media strangers.
- Discovering that I’d never listened to Neil Young’s self-titled record apart from the hits. Listening and loving it (duh) (via Colin).
- The person on the plane home from LA wearing one of those designer bulletproof vests.
- The person on the plane with football rings on every finger of his right hand.
