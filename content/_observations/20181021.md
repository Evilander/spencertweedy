- Going to a cutesy, log-cabin-themed bar with Henry and Hayden where the music (Rolling Stones) was blaring so loudly we could barely talk to each other.
	- Watching the bartender fill a tiny bowl for a dog who had come in (with owner).
- â€œLiking" the Andy Richter tweet that "Every guitar solo ever could have been shorter" but then unliking it in case my liking could be misinterpreted as anti-guitar drummer hate.
