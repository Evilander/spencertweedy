- The snow-capped stones in Naches River.
- The primordial urge to climb a mountain that stands in front of you. Just to see what’s up there, what it’s like up there.
- The little kids trudging home from the school bus through snow in Naches, Washington.
- The knives and swords for sale at the truck stop in Mission, Oregon, large and plentiful even by truck stop standards.
- The beautiful mountain pass we tried to take to Seattle in order to avoid bad conditions on I-90, which we discovered to be closed after 40 miles of following it (and, thankfully, 40 miles of enjoying the gorgeous trees that line it).
	- The friendly clerk at Whistlin’ Jack’s gas station who gave us advice to bypass the pass.
