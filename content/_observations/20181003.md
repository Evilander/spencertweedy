- How, although the leaves started falling as long ago as 8-27-18, most of them are still on the trees.
- The big, rubber wheels on the new marimba in the school percussion studio.
- The deanâ€™s office door bulletin board with Wendell Berry and Richard Brautigan poems on it. Wondering whether the duplicate copy of Brautigan's "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace" was an accident or for emphasis.
