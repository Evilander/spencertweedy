- Driving home from Missouri, making up songs and listening to podcasts with Casey and Sammy.
- [This](https://frontier.is/newsletters/for-the-time-being/) is exactly the kind of creative company I want to have: “CW&T is itself just a container for our creative practice. Sometimes we make a piece of software, sometimes a painting, sometimes a tool or a toy we want to use around the house. We don’t think of it as a large or growing endeavor, but rather as a sustainable practice that allows us to be creative, supports our family, and gives us a way to relate to a community.”
