 - Stephen Wolfram’s blog post “Finally We May Have a Path to the Fundamental Theory of Physics… and It’s Beautiful.” Almost all of the math and physics goes over my head, but the idea that super complex, world-like structures could arise from deceptively simple origins is exciting and pleasant to think about.
- Donald Hall’s essay “Between Solitude and Loneliness.” Specifically how, within it, he casually and sweetly refers to his and his wife Jane Kenyon’s “daily fuck.”
- Wondering how microscopes *find* their tiny targets. I can believe we have the tech to see tiny things; it’s harder to believe that, after the zoom has blown up the medium into a massive sea of nothingness, that the microscope can find what it’s actually looking for.
