- The weathered pregnancy test packaging on the ground.
- The sunflowers growing in the tiny strip of soil between apartment building and sidewalk.
- The robin’s egg blue propane truck.
- The joy of my cousin’s piano-playing (8-11-18) emanating from the basement.
- Working on Sammy’s beautiful new music.
- The photo portfolio of Whitten Sabbatini, timeless and tasteful and communicative.
- Watching mind-boggling Aretha Franklin videos with Mom and relatives.
