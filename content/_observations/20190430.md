- Looking to Shen Yun as a model for the promotion of our tiny homegrown farm festival at Avrom Farm ([avromfarmparty.com](https://avromfarmparty.com/)).
- The neighborhood clothing store advertising “good stuff, $7.99-$14.99.”
- Among all their many horrible offenses, feeling frustrated that white supremacists have co-opted the “OK” hand signal (especially when thumbs-up isn’t adequate, like when you’re signaling a monitor engineer).
