- On one walk, finding a bat smooshed on the ground and a baby bird smooshed on the ground. :(
- Taking Zaid to Superdawg [[5-8-19](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/050819.html)] with Dad, and talking to owner Lisa, a daughter of founders Maurie and Flaurie.
	- They still have Wilco’s *SPIN* Superdawg photo shoot spreads up in the dining room.
- The older bar patrons (one of whom was in a wheelchair) craning their bodies, reaching over a table, to hold each other’s hands during a whole performance.
- The free jazz musicians crowded around an iPhone to watch an NBA highlight.
