- “[Damsel In Distress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpkIGGJMHBA){: .music}” by Rufus Wainwright.
- *[Oh, God!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GX8GGhp_2pA)* (1977) with Dad and Sammy — a movie that says it's *possible* and *necessary* for us to make the world better, not to wait for divine action. George Burns plays God. John Denver plays neo-Moses. Worth watching!
