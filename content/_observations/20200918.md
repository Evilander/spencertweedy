- Playing our first live show since the start of quarantine, at the drive-in theater in McHenry, Illinois!
	- Seeing so many people in the audience with Tweedy Show masks, shirts, even Costco pajamas.
	- Dad’s breath, visible in the cold.
	- The beautiful, shimmering projection on the massive movie screen behind us.
	- Starting the show “Mi Sheberach” for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and everyone.
