- Getting half off our hotel stay in Richmond, Virginia, because there were huge flakes of human skin and hair on one of our beds???
- Tearing up at Armand Patoineâ€™s story in [Rumble Strip](https://rumblestripvermont.com/2022/09/armands-garden/). So worth your time.
- The sandbags still in place for Hurricane Ian in Columbia, South Carolina.
- Playing with Finom at New Brookland Tavern in Columbia.
