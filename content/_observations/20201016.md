- “[Automatic Slim and the Fat Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS3sdoGgG8){: .music}” by Michael Hurley.
	- Hurley’s “dawn’s early light” reminding me that in all my childhood, I thought “dawn’s early” of the national anthem was a single adjective, like “dawnserly.”
- At a socially distanced hang, a friend dropping her phone into a campfire, and me pulling it out with a conveniently located pair of fire tongs. It survived with screen damage.
