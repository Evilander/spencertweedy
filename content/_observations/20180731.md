- Waking up at eleven and staying in bed till two, a first for the summer.
- Accidentally spelling “font” as “phont” more than once.
- The impromptu Jackson 5 dance party with Mom.
- The new Bernard Purdie record, so good and inspiring because it’s better than what one might expect from ‘60s veterans’ new records (thanks Billy).
- The infant’s play gym strapped to the roof of a Forester.
- The bank teller who acted like my request for change was some bizarre, new form of performance art.
- The purpose-built, yellow Kodak photo-processing PCs at Target.
- Recycling printer ink that had been sitting around, waiting, for years.
- Getting a professional massage for the first time since past festival seasons’ fancy backstages.
	- The masseuse’s cigarette tar sniffles.
	- My Adam’s apple pressing so hard into the face hole I thought I might choke.
	- Smelling like a delicious, chemical version of cucumbers for twelve hours afterward.
- Hoping Fig Newtons stay afloat in this new, fig-unfriendly world.
