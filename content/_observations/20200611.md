- The *60 Minutes* segment about Italian composer Francesco Lotoro, who’s spent decades recovering and performing musical compositions that Jews had written while imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. He visits survivors and survivors’ children and it is so beautiful to see the light in their eyes, the gratitude they feel that someone cares about their ancestor or their parent’s work, that someone is keeping it alive.
