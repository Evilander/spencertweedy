- The BILLIE EILISH show at United Center. Her and Finneas, singing together with nothing but acoustic guitars (for a portion of the show). Finneas’s awesome beats. Billie’s sweet banter and of course her voice.
- Rey, from my favorite discount power tool shop, talking about the sound of the aquarium in his shop giving him energy in the mornings, “even more than coffee.”
