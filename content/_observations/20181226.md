- Sitting in Zaid’s 1980s massage chair while waiting for an AT&T repairperson to arrive.
	- The fake keyboard clacking noises on AT&T’s (and others’) customer support calls. [1-1-19: Apple is the only major corp I’ve heard that tells its callers that the robot on the other end is a robot. AT&T really tries to pass it off.]
- The debate about whether we should wish for a moonshot candidate or an appeasement-to-racist-whites candidate in 2020. I don’t want to be naive, but I think a moonshot candidate—a woman of color under seventy with great ideas and a straightforward manner of communicating—would be the more principled option and our best chance at winning *because* it’s the more principled option. Left-leaning people are tired of settling and tired of making decisions based on what Republicans will *let* us do instead of what we *ought* to do. I think we should be unabashedly principled and honest about what we want. 2016 shows us that “electability” is largely a mythical concept, anyway.
- *New York Times’* amazing, interactive story about the recent Lion Air disaster.
