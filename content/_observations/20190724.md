- The inescapable feeling of the heat last weekend (~115º index). When you’re comfortable, it’s easy to think you could “think your way out” of discomfort like that (similarly to how a person without depression might wish a person *with* depression could snap out of it). But it’s amazing how quickly comfort can come to feel impossibly far away.
