- The plastic skeletons for sale at Menards, folded up, hanging on the racks, ready to go.
- [This interview](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/we-spoke-with-the-last-person-standing-in-the-floppy-disk-business/) with the “last person standing” in the floppy disk business. I used floppy disks when I was in elementary school.
- The concept of a “messianic duo”: not a single savior, but a couple of collaborating saviors.
	- The [bizarre stories](https://www.kotzkblog.com/2018/12/206-david-reuveni-and-shlomo-molcho.html) of David Reuveni and Shlomo Molcho, which I found by googling “messianic duo.” It turns out that in the sixteenth century, pretty much all you needed in order to get a meeting with the Pope was a white horse.
