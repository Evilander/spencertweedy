- [Buck Meek](https://buckmeek.bandcamp.com/){: .music} and [Kidi Band](https://kidiband.bandcamp.com/){: .music} at Lincoln Hall. Nearly crying at Adam Brisbin’s tuned-in guitar-playing.
- The spectrum of believing the world is full of assholes out to get you or sweethearts out to help you.
	- That where you sit on that spectrum affects how you treat others. Believe there are assholes, preemptively be an asshole. Believe there are sweethearts, be a sweetheart. Roughly.
	- How, in that way, your belief is self-fulfilling, since you too are part of the world.
	- That some people claim to know the true nature of humans, so they present their asshole-sweetheart belief as scientific fact.
	- How damaging that can be, when they influence other people with their beliefs, making the world a little bit more like the vision they claim is already reality.
		- An example: the “[tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).”
