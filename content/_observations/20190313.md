- Answering questions from the Chicago Department of Public Health for fifteen minutes about my salmonella [[2-25-19](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/022519.html)].
- The miniature wine bottle on the ground outside the senior physical rehab center.
- Watching Leroy Bach, Dan Bitney, and Ben Lamar Gay perform at California Clipper. They were great.
