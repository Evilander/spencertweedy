- The glass case full of (functional? backup?) firefighting gear in the hotel. Do the firefighters show up gearless?
- The American guests having their mugs from home filled with margaritas at the pool bar. Eco-friendly but somehow also imposing.
- Finding a lizard with Casey and her naming it Roger.
