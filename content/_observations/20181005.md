- How it is hard to divorce the word "fecund" from its similarity to "fecal."
- The 1976 General Foods ad explaining why scary-sounding ingredient lists aren't so scary with a mix of defensiveness, condescension, and admirable directness (found in that Facebook "mid-century ad" page).
- Going to an art opening with a "scent curator.‚Äù
	- Watching two patrons walk in and almost immediately touch the paintings. Feeling simultaneously (1) indignant that anyone assumes that's okay and (2) down with the cause of making art accessible, touchable, personal.
- The used latex glove on the ground.
