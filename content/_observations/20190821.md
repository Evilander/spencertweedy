- Glimpsing a TSA agent’s pen doodles on her passport-checking desk.
- The Linux system error screen scrolling rapidly on a plane’s flight attendant control panel.
- Since I’m traveling to work on a book project, I put back on my mildly corrective glasses, as is required by nerd law.
- The ancient-seeming shuttle bus shutting down in the middle of the street, and the driver restarting it.
- While falling asleep, this phrase: “a glass of water juice.”
