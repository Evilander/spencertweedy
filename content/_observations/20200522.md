- Watching a groundhog (or some other similar-looking animal) run across the yard to… burrow beneath our deck.
- Grilling Beyond Burgers outdoors on a real charcoal grill — summer.
- Before bed, four drone sounds:
	- The nearby highway.
	- The fan in Sammy’s gaming laptop.
	- The water pipes on the way to Casey’s shower.
	- The rhythmically sloshing dishwasher.
