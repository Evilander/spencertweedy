- The mattress on the sidewalk with bullet-hole-looking holes in it.
- Opening an old tool box and unleashing a decades-old horseradish smell.
- The concept of a “classically trained dumbass.”
- The noise floor and weird harmonics of a Farfisa keyboard.
- Going to Guitar Center for an emergency studio supply and elitistly joking about needing a belay/buddy system to avoid getting sucked into the store.
- Using a Topo Chico bottle as a guitar slide with Topo Chico still in it.
- The Judy Collins song “Farewell to Tarwathie” where she sings over whale recordings, a genius but emotionally cruel arrangement.
- The Columbia Journalism Review profile of Tucker Carlson: “What happened to make a rich white man the vox populi? How did I, a mom in the Midwest who can’t afford health care, become the humorless, censoring, liberal elite?”
