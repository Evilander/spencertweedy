- Playing the Beach Stage at Sky Blue Sky with Dad, Sammy and the gang.
- A beautiful band dinner.
- Reading Wikipedia articles about warplanes till the wee hours of the morning. On “accident.”
	- Learning that the designs we think of as the epitome of modern war machines (namely, “semi-monocoque fuselage[s] with a large-cantilever, shoulder-mounted wing” like that of the F-15) were introduced in the 70s. Who knew!
	- We have spent so much fucking money on these things, but I’m not convinced that that’s wrong…. I don’t want contractors to rob the country, but I also don’t want to be vulnerable to insane, belligerent nations. The depressing, violent pickle we’ve been in for a century. (How about we spend more money taking care of each other at home in addition to maintaining strong defenses? The money is there for both. And leverage Boeing, Lockheed et al. into charging less?)
