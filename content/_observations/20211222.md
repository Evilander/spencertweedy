- Metro night 1. On Sammy’s birthday! It felt so good.
- “[If You Ever Find Yourself](https://audacity.substack.com/p/if-you-ever-find-yourself){: .prose}” by Erika J. Simpson. How, sometimes, reading stories about people who overcome systemic injustice with love can make me momentarily complacent. Like, "Wow, the problems that caused Erika's suffering are so deep and so pervasive, but I guess I don't have to do anything about them because she had love and she ended up OK.” But that's not how it works. Just because Erika made the best of things and found support doesn't mean that the systems that were stacked against her are tolerable.
