- Voting in the Chicago municipal election and Illinois primary.
	- The bored election judge exhaling “Fuuuck.”
- The unfortunate wording of a GoFundMe fundraiser: “… to pay their rent due to the COVID-19 virus.”
- The “Family Doctor” sign blinking erratically at night.
- The musty smell of the sixties Echoplex tape delay machine at the Loft.
- Feeling amazed, as we often do, at how quickly some really abnormal circumstances have started to feel normal. Practically overnight.
