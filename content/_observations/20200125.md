- Buying a shirt from the Scouts de México store with Mom. Then, running into a Scout meeting in a park, feeling grateful I wasn’t wearing my new uniform (lest I get mistaken for an eight-year-old Scout).
- The street quesadilla seller making tortillas from scratch with gray putty-like dough dug out of a bucket.
- Doing the accidental-flash-photo thing at a show (a Wilco show!) for maybe the first time ever, and the Hubble Telescope-esque red-hot photo of the inside of my hand I have to show for it.
