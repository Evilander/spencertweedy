- Biking with Casey in the forest preserve, the same woods I biked when I was little, my end-of-summer goal. The feeling of contentedness from exercise, seeing those woods again, and the mfing pre-fall wind.
	- Stopping by the lagoon.
	- Watching people fish for food.
	- The bench plaque that read “In honor of all those whom [sic] served in Operation Iraqi Freedom / Operation Enduring Freedom.”
- Watching two young, short kids struggle to use a ketchup dispenser and helping them while their dad watched football.
- The two men repairing a washing machine under lamplight in an otherwise dark, empty laundromat.
- Collecting signatures to get a mayoral candidate on the ballot in Chicago. Most people being nice, but one guy shooting me down (I’m an inexperienced canvasser so those moments sting).
- Adopting a new “no flipping the LP while the turntable plate is still spinning” policy after almost ruining a record (and the needle).
	- Playing a record I bought based on its album cover more than four years ago, thinking pessimistically that I would never actually listen to it, and loving it (Drums Like Machine Guns / Mincemeat or Tenspeed split from 2007).
