- Eating a delicious lobster roll at a suspicious, bowling-alley-attached restaurant.
- [Alan Jacobs](https://blog.ayjay.org/dna/): “I don’t expect that anyone will be reading my stuff after I die — I expect that I’ll be wholly forgotten *before* I die, if I live to a good age — but I almost never think about that. At the end of *Middlemarch* George Eliot says of Dorothea that ‘the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts,’ and that captures better than I can my convictions on this point. *Diffusive* is the key word: an influence that subtly spreads, perhaps without anyone noticing. I find that model of influence more encouraging and comforting than any hopes for fame could ever be.”
