- Eating a block of cheese at a gas station in Aberdeen, Maryland.
- Playing with Finom at Comet Ping Pong in Washington D.C.
	- The kind and skilled sound tech, training a young woman sound tech.
	- The families playing ping pong in the venue room in the time leading up to our sound check. (Turns out Comet Ping Pong really has ping pong. But [no basement](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2021/07/07/theres-nothing-you-can-do-legacy-pizzagate).)
- Itâ€™s not decadent to be loved!
