- Ellsworth Kelly’s paintings, which I had never seen before (thanks Oona).
- Contestants in the Solid Sound Wilco Karaoke contest supporting each other with nice comments on their Instagram posts.
- Van Dyke Parks’s song “High Coin,” recorded by The Charlatans (thanks Sammy).
- Ordering kimchi soup at King Spa and receiving it literally still boiling (bubbling) hot, not sure what to do with it.
