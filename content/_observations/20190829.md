- The cicada that flew in the window of my car (while parked). Thinking that a neighboring parked car had thrown something at us — a spitball? — before I found the invading culprit.
- Going back to AutoZone [[3-22-19](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/032219.html)], this time for a fuse. The clerk didn’t want to help. Sammy said Hank Hill would have been ashamed of the service.
- *The Magic of Believing What You See*, a beautiful new album by Star Moles and produced by my friend Kevin Basko. Listen to “Slime,” at least (starmoles.bandcamp.com).
