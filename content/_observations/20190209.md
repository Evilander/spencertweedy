- Watching hawks and an eagle (!) fly around outside the studio window.
- Hayden getting cornered by a carpenter who, recognizing the chainsaw brand name on Hayden’s hat, talked to him about chainsaws for thirty minutes. (On machines in general: “I’m articulate about this shit.”)
- How sometimes the kick drum lives below the bass guitar and sometimes the bass is below the kick. *C’est la vie.*
- How a lot of what gets qualified as empathy might actually just be typical, intellectual learning—coming to know someone’s preferences and tendencies, but not necessarily feeling their feelings.
