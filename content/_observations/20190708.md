- Remembering the cute, kinda ambitious CSS3-animated website I made for dBpm Records in 2011 (archived on Archive.org).
- Sweeping up dried rat turds like hockey pucks in a basement storage space.
- Hearing kids singing through the walls of a mosque.
- Rebecca Solnit writing about the “tyranny of the quantifiable” in *Men Explain Things to Me*: how quantifiable are easy to express and deal in, so they get outsize weight, while “slipperier things” get ignored. A first step of lots of world-bettering is naming and describing what we want to value.
- Amazing insights about Prince’s recording process from the engineer Susan Rogers’s Red Bull Academy interview:
	- “He lived on Doritos and cake.”
	- “16 [hours] would be a fairly short session, but we frequently did 24 hours. That was fairly common. That was how long it took, because he never wanted to come back to a song. If he started it, he wanted to do all the overdubs and mixing as we went, and then print it and then it would be done. […] I’d make his cassette copy. I’d sleep my customary three hours. The phone would ring, I’d pick up the phone and his voice would go, ‘Ready?’ ‘Yeah.’ Then it would go all over again.”
