- Co-running the second annual Avrom Farm Party with my bandmate Hayden, on his farm.
	- Beautiful sets by Al Scorch, Jess Sah Bi & Peter One, Jenny & The Hog Drovers, Henry True, and Glass Mountain — and a surprise set by my dad.
	- Jess Sah Bi & Peter One joyfully yet seriously sharing stories about their experiences in apartheid South Africa. (Listen to their album *Our Garden Needs Its Flowers*.)
	- Hundreds of pounds of Avrom Farm’s beans, greens, and pasture-raised pork.
