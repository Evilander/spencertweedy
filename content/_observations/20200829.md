- Phonebanking for Wisconsin Democrats again. A rougher experience than [last time]({% link _observations/20200808.md %}).
	- An older Republican on the phone who sounded as close to Elmer Fudd as a human can sound: “We hate Democrats! You wanna spend all our money, you idiots! Senator \[sic] Pelosi should be sh\*t!”
- The short documentary *John Was Trying to Contact Aliens*. Just as great as everyone says it is. I highly recommend it.
