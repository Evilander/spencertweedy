> I think one thing we could jettison is this concept of independence. It’s not that helpful. In many ways, the meme of independence *won*. Now everyone is individuated, and independently free to compete with one another to sell their time and wares on the platforms, and the reality of that is a pretty precarious and unfulfilling existence for most. When everyone is *independent*, it turns out that we don’t have much collective bargaining power to influence anything all, or at least those with the most wealth or resources will dominate.

Mat and musician Holly Herndon have a podcast called *Interdependence*. (There is also a section about independence versus interdependence in my book, *[Mirror Sound](https://bookshop.org/books/mirror-sound-the-people-and-processes-behind-self-recorded-music/9783791386539)*!)
