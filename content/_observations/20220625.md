- Sammy’s and my improvised synthesizer-and-drums duo show at Mu Gallery, opening for [BSA Gold](https://bsagold.bandcamp.com/){: .music}.
- Casey’s DJ set at Golden Dagger benefitting [Chicago Abortion Fund](https://www.chicagoabortionfund.org).
- Driving behind a freakily reckless car, whose occupants got out at every stop light to twerk on the street and/or on the hood of the car.
