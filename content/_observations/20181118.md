- Goodbye tea/coffee with my academic advisor, who is awesome and with whom I loved working.
- Packing up my dorm room.
- Saying goodbye to friends!
- Deleting the â€œSchool" folder alias shortcut on my laptop desktop.
- Hearing a loud fart on the library quiet study floor.
- The students who set up a fireplace video on the classroom projector to study beneath it.
- Wondering how the government deals with the length of embargoed text giving information to readers. [e.g. after the 12-7-18 Michael Cohen document came out, someone on Twitter figured out that one redacted box would fit you-know-whose name perfectly.]
