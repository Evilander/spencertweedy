- The patch of concrete with a shag carpet-looking texture.
- Dirty Projectors’ beautiful video for “Overlord.”
- Watching *Floor Show* with Casey at the Chopin Theater, “an art/rock/show inspired by the sound and vision of David Bowie” by Alex Grelle and Jesse Morgan Young and music-directed by Liam Kazar.
	- The poignance of seeing a packed room adapting, honoring, and keeping Bowie’s music alive.
