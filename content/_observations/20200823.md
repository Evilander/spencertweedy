- Stopped at a red light, watching a bucket-drumming performer get handed what must have been a large bill, and him running to his bucket-drumming partner on the other corner, super excitedly.
- How the smell of others’ homes gets in your clothes. (Something foreign in COVID time but remembered today, as Casey and I safely recorded in a friend’s home studio.)
- The difference between coping mechanisms that deal with uncomfortable feelings and those that deal with the causes of those feelings (when there *are* findable causes).
- The under-construction car wash lit up at night, with its brand-new wiggly wipers still in plastic.
