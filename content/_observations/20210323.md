- The giant iron blast doors in the side of the mountain at the Riverway Bridge, and the caverns beyond them, which, Sammy read, used to store dynamite.
- The Utah sandstones with their crepe-like striations, with tiny little holes pocking all over, with patches of pale green lichen, with sheer, flat faces.
- The boulder whose silhouette, Mom noticed, looks like a massive frog with a yarmulke on.
- The young kid somersaulting down a sand hill that looked like the Sarlacc Pit.
