- The wind rocking our parked bus like a cradle.
- The cliffside with little white rocks embedded in it, like the crisped rice nuggets in a Crunch bar.
- The lizards rustling the leaves along the hiking trail.
- The scaly spray paint skin on the Cadillacs at Cadillac Ranch.
- The thrift store with 28 copies of Trivial Pursuit for sale, all stacked on a high shelf.
	- The cashier at that store coughing freestyle (no mask, no elbow).
