- Ignoring the expiration date on a BelGioioso mozzarella cheese ball—a big step of courage for me—and being betrayed by it. It was rotten.
- Noticing (or projecting) disdain on the face of a classmate during a discussion about the “college students are coddled and taught that everything they feel is right” popular op-ed belief. He sides, or would side, with the reactionary op-ed writers.
	- The same classmate talking about buying cigars.
- The mom and her son struggling to fit a massive rolled-up carpet into their mini-van.
- The sign advertising “*custom* knees” (emphasis mine).
- The hay wagon crossing the highway, Frogger-style.
- Finding myself in a sports bar where a bong trade show was happening. The incidence of caucasian dreads among attendees.
- Claes Oldenburg talking about a plastic toy ladybug in a sculpture-in-progress of his, in the New York Times Magazine: “I told her to get lost, but she’s still here. Maybe she’ll stay.”
