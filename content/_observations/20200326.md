- *Nevada Fighter* by Michael Nesmith & The First National Band (via Dad). Soo good.
- A couple at Costco: “Do you need pickles?” “[impatient] I can live without ’em.” “[annoyed] No you can’t.”
- In the Costco parking lot, too many littered gloves to count.
- The new Dylan song, “Murder Most Foul.”
