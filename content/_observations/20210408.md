- Pulling over to help an older guy who seemed to be having trouble. I thought he was having a heart attack but it turned out he was drunk (and still needing medical attention). He wanted me to call an ambulance so I did, and while we were waiting for it he said I look like Steve Winwood and cried that a stranger (me), “not even my son,” was helping him.
