- Putting a decently deep gash in my palm by holding a piece of wood as I tried to drill into a work piece on top of it. Kind of worrying, superstitiously, that the scar, a new palm reading line, would change my life in a freaky way.
- Big Thiefâ€™s beautiful show at the Riviera Theatre, at which they felt around for the path in new material, letting everyone see their communication and trust in each other.
