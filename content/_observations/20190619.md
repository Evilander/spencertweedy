- The singed-black (or just dirty?) latex glove on the ground [[2-28-19](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/022819.html) et al.].
- Going through computer game CD-ROMS from my childhood with Mom (Freddie Fish, Pajama Sam, Monster Maker).
- Feeling lucky that I grew up in an anti-prank household, and with more or less anti-prank friends.
