- This memory: being six years old and playing with my first-generation iPod (a hand-me-down from Dad) while I was supposed to be asleep; turning on a Black Sabbath song right as my dad happened to walk past my bedroom; wanting to turn it down because it was at ear-splitting volume (and the volume would alert my dad), but pretending to be asleep instead, laying there with Sabbath pummeling my ears until he came over and (rightly) reprimanded me.
