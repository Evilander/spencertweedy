- The car engines on stands in the windows of an auto repair shop, as if they were hearts on trays in a hospital’s windows.
- The *New Yorker* story about a rural telecom co-op that built gigabit internet access for every single resident and business in town.
	- Keith Gabbard, CEO of Peoples Rural Telephone Cooperative: “Someone has to build to the last mile. The big telecom companies aren’t going to do it, because it’s not economical and they have shareholders to answer to. We’re a co-op. We’re owned by our members. We answer to each other.”
- Attending a Zoom training session for get-out-the-vote phonebanking led by a sweet and exuberant volunteer, with a Wisconsin accent, eager to gush about his professional phonebanking headset.
