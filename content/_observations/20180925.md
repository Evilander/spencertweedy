- Slicing a pretty big gash into my thumb during sculpture class.
- Running my head into a nail (hammer-side, thankfully) during sculpture class.
- The sparks shooting out from nail-gun nails hitting the concrete floor during sculpture class.
- This quote from ancient philosopher Mozi: “What is the cause of great men abandoning the administration of the government and the common people neglecting their work? It is music!” (Apparently he wasn’t against all music, just the elaborate Cirque du Soleil-type.)
- This Ursula K. Le Guin quote: “This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain.”
- My friend, who has diabetes, rattling off insulin pump brand names and talking excitedly about the new one she just ordered.
