- The tiny chihuahua that lives (and works?) in the auto shop by my house.
- Finding an ID badge of a private detective agency employee (marked “CIVILIAN”) on the ground.
- The fire hydrant with a makeshift drinking fountain attached to it.
- The parent and child biking and rollerblading, respectively, in the street, bike-parent pulling the rollerblade-child.
