- Waking up with “Blue Sky” by Allman Brothers Band stuck in my head.
- The WWE figurines at Walmart.
- My heart pounding while I watched an older couple fall over on a stationary motorcycle. (They were okay.)
- The 1921 book, *How to Psycho-Analyze Yourself* by Joseph Ralph, my uncle gave to my mom for her birthday.
	- The amazing gold lettering on its cover.
	- The *Psychoanalytic Review* review that criticized it for being too prude and celebrated it for “aid[ing] the great work of mental hygiene.”
- The young relative announcing, at the perfect comedic moment, that he hated all of us. (It was a temporary, Mountain Dew-induced tantrum.)
- Watching stars, and satellites, and meteors during the Perseids shower with family.
	- How it seems like most of the time spent watching a meteor shower is actually spent complaining about the meteors you missed while you looked away.
	- The wonder of spotting satellites, which seem somehow more distant and foreign than visible planets.
	- The campaign merch boondoggle of Trump’s Space Force.
