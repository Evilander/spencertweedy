- The three, buff, fifyish, ball Ukrainian men filling up their trucks at a gas station in New York State, staring us (Finom) down (friendlily?).
- Learning (from my dear friend Elijah) that high school students have been using DALL-E 2 AI technology to synthesize homework and college applications.
- Playing with Finom at TV Eye in NYC.
- Waiting thirty-plus minutes for fried food from a bodega in Queens at 3AM that turned out to be some of the worst food weâ€™d ever eaten (surprise), but which nonetheless gave us life.
