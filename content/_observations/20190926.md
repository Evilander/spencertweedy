- Running sound for the Chicago Cellar Boys, a 1920s and ’30s jazz band.
	- How, even if you’d be bored by this music on a record, it’s undeniably exciting live.
	- Some of their fans, in 1920s clothes, showing again [[5-16-19](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/051619.html)] that cosplaying patrons are often nicer than non-cosplaying ones. Maybe because they’re doing what they love.
	- While turning on the house music, feeling like it’s hostile to play contemporary records in between an anachronistic band’s sets.
	- My *Arrested Development* squawking Gob chicken ringtone accidentally blaring over the bar’s PA.
