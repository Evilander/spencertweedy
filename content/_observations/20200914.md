- How well photos of loved ones do their job — they keep them on your mind. I have a photo of my friend’s mom, who died last year, on my bookshelf and I look at it almost every day. I used to think photos like that make you numb to their loss, turn them into static fixtures. But this photo doesn’t; it reminds me of her every time.
