- The package delivery person walking up to a disaster scene: Casey and me knee-deep in cardboard, trying to free a newly delivered couch from its sarcophagus in-place where it was delivered (the foyer of her building), creating a mountain of cardboard and styrofoam rubble that blocked anyone else from entering or exiting the building. And offering to help us.
