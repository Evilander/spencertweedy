- Hoping that, if Neuralink-type thingies eventually help us think, we’ll still make decisions and even mistakes based on the rickety, semi-rational, ineffable way we think now. Art partly relies on it!
	- I wonder about all the Luddite movements of the past. Did old-school carpenters worry that electric saws would make carpentry inhumane? I think carpenters and woodworkers are making plenty beautiful things that bear the mark of human touch with electric saws, so if the analogy holds up, that could be cause not to fear AI hybridism. But it’s worth thinking about!
