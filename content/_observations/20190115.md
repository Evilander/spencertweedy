- Talking to a class of percussion students at Senn High School about drumming, professional playing, and life after high school. I braced myself to be ignored/ridiculed/pied in the face but they were engaged and sweet.
	- A student with special needs playing badass fills with a drumstick balanced on his head.
- Watching Free Snacksâ€™ debut show (download their mixtape, freesnacks.bandcamp[.]com).
- Feeding carrots to Basil.
