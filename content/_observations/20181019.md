- Hayden's amazing cordless-drill-powered leaf harvester and how it was invented six or so years ago.
	- The excitement I feel that farming has been around for over 10,000 years and people are *still* finding simple but huge ways to make it better (Avrom Farm can harvest hundreds of pounds of vegetables in way less time now without having to use a vehicle or completely change their farming practice). The futuristic urban greenhouses with hyper-engineered lighting and irrigation are one thing; a sack made out of canvas with some spinny ropes and a cordless drill are another, more inspiring thing to me.
- Enduring, but also kind of appreciating, the choreography and sales script of an oil change at a franchise shop, which was more intense and enthusiastic than they usually are.
	- “I hope you didn't feel pressured to buy anything. I just really care about your car.”
- The roadside marquee that said "SICK OF WINNING YET?” Me, not being able to tell whether it was for or against Trump.
- How Elizabeth Fraser (Cocteau Twins) is an underrated singer.
- Watching a driver tweeze her neck while stopped at a red light.
- Walking past a guy cutting his toe nails on his front porch.
- Spotting two vaping Lyft/Uber drivers.
