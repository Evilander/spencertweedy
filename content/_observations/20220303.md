- Driving to Columbia for [True/False Film and Music Festival](https://truefalse.org/), where Sammy, Casey, Liam, Lane and I are playing.
	- The amazing documentary about one of the pioneers of bullet-proof vests, Richard Davis, called *[2nd Chance](https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/2nd-chance-review-ramin-bahrani-1235195430/)*. The bravery and goodness and sincerity of the people in Davisâ€™s wake, putting a kick in my pandemic-dampened heart.
