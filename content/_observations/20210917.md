- At the Wilco show in Green Bay, WI, a guy looking for his wedding ring in the astroturf of Capital Credit Union Park. Bystanders turning on their phone flashlights to help him. *More* bystanders turning on their phone flashlights in an expanding ring of tiny search lights. I donâ€™t think the guy found his ring. He was quite drunk.
