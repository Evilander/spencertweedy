- The *New York Times* story about Candice Payne, who bought thirty hotel rooms for people experiencing homelessness in Chicago during the cold a few weeks ago.
	- How the thirty rooms snowballed into sixty, plus donated food and goods, as people found out about the story and sent money to Candice.
	- “I am a regular person. It all sounded like a rich person did this, but I’m just a little black girl from the South Side. I thought it was unattainable, but after seeing this and seeing people from all around the world, that just tells me that it’s not that unattainable. We can all do this together.”
- How my family has always been disgusted (and confused) that I say words like “important” and “often” with a hard T.
