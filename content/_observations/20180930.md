- Going through my entire Dribbble.com subscription list to find cool designers to send to Sammy, feeling nostalgic both for the heyday of the site and on behalf of the designers who seem to have quit the biz when skeuomorphic design went out of fashion. I think design is better because of the shift but a lot of awe-inspiring illustration skill was left behind (a lot of people have written about that).
- Sheepishly ordering a pumpkin spice latte at a coffee shop, only to find out that they had run out for the day.
- The screenshot of a monkey drummer from the Kiev National Circus (thanks Uncle Bruce).
