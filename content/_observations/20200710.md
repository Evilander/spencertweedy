- Driving home from New York City just hours after arriving at it.
	- Passing through the Pennsylvania towns of Butler, Sugarloaf, and Drums on the way.
	- And a duo kayaking in rain on the Delaware River.
	- The plastic-wrapped bread roll and a clove of garlic — new roots sprouting — left behind in Sammy’s dorm kitchen cabinets.
	- Listening to all of *Sandinista!* (my first time), mostly in Ohio while the sun came up.
	- Arriving at home almost exactly 36 hours after leaving, lying in bed with this weird floating sensation from sleep deprivation and Red Bull afterglow.
