- How, when I use my familyâ€™s new Dyson vacuum cleaner, it feels like the walls ratchet up into the sky, our roof slides off, lights and cameras repel in, and Iâ€™m on a soundstage shooting an ad for Dyson, where I play the incredulous young guy who canâ€™t believe how well the vacuum works on every surface, every time, with hardly any noise, so much better than any other vacuum heâ€™s seen in his twenty-four years of life, and Mom plays the mom whoâ€™s excited her son is finally enthusiastic about a vacuum.
