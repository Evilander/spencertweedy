- Erica Chenoweth’s research about social movements (via the *BBC*):
	- “Overall, nonviolent campaigns were twice as likely to succeed as violent campaigns: they led to political change 53% of the time compared to 26% for the violent protests.”
	- “’There weren’t any campaigns that had failed after they had achieved 3.5% participation during a peak event.’”
- The troll doll lying in the middle of the street.
- Panic’s new Playdate game console (co-designed with Teenage Engineering, makers of the OP-1 and Pocket Operator synths). Sooo inspiring (design-wise).
