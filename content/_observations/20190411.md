- The barely audible tape bleed ghost vocal in the break of “So Wrong” by Patsy Cline.
- Eating a Taco Ball Cantina veggie burrito for the first time, in a last-minute dinner before playing with Henry at the Whistler.
- The impromptu Soul Train dance party we held outside the Whistler after the show, inspired (and facilitated) by the person blasting house music out of their parked minivan. We stayed there, dancing and accosting strangers, for at least thirty minutes.
