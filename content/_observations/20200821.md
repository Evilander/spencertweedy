- The unbelievably badass version of “[Three Hundred Pounds Of Joy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzHXBJKP72U){: .music}” from *Howlin’ Wolf’s New Album*.
- Delving into random video chat Omegle with Casey, through which we
	- met a super sweet person in Mexico City;
	- convinced two pre-teen girls to take their brother’s Confederate flag off the wall (“Will he be mad?” we asked. “He’ll get over it,” they responded);
	- befriended a group of four thirteen-year-olds partying at Lake Tahoe, who all follow Casey on TikTok now.
