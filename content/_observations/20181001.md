- Getting a huge care package of snacks from my aunt Debbie. :)
	- Accidentally slicing a little cut in my hand while opening it, my second such slice in a week [9-25-18].
- The student DJ at the radio station talking with super-endearing passion about contra dance music: *”It's the most fun you can have with your pants on.”*
- The international student reading Plato's *Republic* with the book in one hand and a little folding translator computer in the other.
