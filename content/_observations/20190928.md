- This amazing Laurie Spiegel quote from an interview in *Apartamento* (thanks, Mom): “The point I kept trying to make was that technology is actually the most human thing about us. It is what differentiates us from all the other animals, though a few animals such as crows actually do make their own tools. Technology is a human thing, and we can create it to be what we want it to be.” I think we need a dose of that thinking, even if (or maybe because) there are lots of tech-borne problems to address.
