- Hoping that the protests don’t die down, that they only grow larger as the weekend ends and the new week starts. While hoping even harder that no more are hurt, that no more are killed, that police somehow shift their response from aggression to contrition.
- Deerhoof’s great new album, *Future Teenage Cave Artists* (and their righteous tweets).
- Roxane Gay in the *NYTimes*, pointing our attention back to *care ethics*: “I write similar things about different black lives lost over and over and over. I tell myself I am done with this subject. Then something so horrific happens that I know I must say something, even though I know that the people who truly need to be moved are immovable. They don’t care about black lives. They don’t care about anyone’s lives. They won’t even wear masks to mitigate a virus for which there is no cure.”
