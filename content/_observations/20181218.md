- Waking up early-ish for wisdom tooth surgery.
	- The pink sunrise.
	- Listening to morning radio and talking about Cardi B and Offset with my Lyft driver, who disapproves of Offset, but who also thinks the florist who tipped off TMZ about the price of his flower arrangement for Cardi should’ve kept quiet.
	- Liam driving me to surgery (*heart eyes*).
	- “Tell Me Something Good” on in the waiting room.
- Afterward, Casey tolerating my slurping while eating.
- The big piece of flesh that came out of one of my tooth sockets.
- Finding reassurance in the fact that the Stickies app is still on Mac.
