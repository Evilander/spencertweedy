- The tiny little tree with a tiny little stabilizing brace on it.
- The antique and junk metal store.
	- The 19th-century-lookin-ass wooden hut on its campus.
	- The lawn full of rusting industrial equipment.
	- The leather saddle, mossy from rain.
- The RVs towing SUVs. Feeling like it’s both cute and excessive to do that.
- Leaving the house in ripped jeans (from natural causes), having just showered, thinking it’s generally a good bet to look disheveled but smell nice, or at least a better bet than the opposite.
- Playing at the Empty Bottle with Hue.
	- The friendly and competent soundperson, Shay/Shae. Soundpeople are so often jaded or bad (or both), it’s really nice when they’re nice.
	- Heading to a seemingly usual, bemuraled corner store for a snack, finding a portal into a Ukrainian super market instead, complete with produce and a seafood deli. Buying imported, peanut-flavored Cheetos called Flips, a sesame sugar cracker, and an apple.
	- The band that left three nearly untouched salads in the green room.
