- Swimming in the hot-as-air water in Lake Monroe with Charles, Malcolm, Macie, and Sima.
- Playing a fun, loud show at The Bishop in Bloomington, Indiana.
- Our friends feeding the “pet” spider on their back porch, Jake, by tossing a moth into its web. All of us gathering to watch the ensuing nature process (wrapping, toting, slurping).
