- Alan Jacobs on how hard it is to decide whether tech giants like Apple are good, bad, useful, useless: “In the end, I think most of us make this kind of decision by some kind of sixth sense, an un-unpackable feel for what’s the best, or the least bad, option in the given circumstances. I wonder if that sense is wholly irrational or whether, on some deep and inaccessible level, it’s actually finding a means to weigh what we don’t consciously know how to weigh.” I like the idea of feelings being a sometimes-acceptable path to beliefs.
