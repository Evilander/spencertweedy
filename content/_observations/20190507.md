- Al Green at the Chicago Theatre with Mom, Dad, and Casey.
	- His voice, sounding just as wide-ranged as it ever was.
	- His band, sounding great and energetic and supportive.
	- His back-up dancers (two, men), coming out only for the big hits, with a subtle costume change each time.
	- The well-stocked, many-flavored table of Gatorade not quite on the side stage, more so on the stage stage.
