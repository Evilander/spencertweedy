- Entering Florida for the first time in my life — on Super Bowl Sunday.
	- The man in O’Hare Airport staring at a cocktail bar’s player piano.
	- Casey and I sleeping with our heads on adjacent airplane tray tables.
- The photo of a pet rabbit on the Yelp page for a wings restaurant, Tasty Wings, in Mangonia Park, Florida.
- Feeling like now, at 24, I’m finally smart enough to understand what’s going on in a football game 1% of the time.
