- Thanksgiving with relatives.
	- My great uncle Mario's Spanish-Israeli sephardic Jewish food.
	- My young cousin excitedly showing me the digital animation he's been working on.
	- Afterward, arguing about one relativeâ€™s religious decision not to hug or touch my mom, who partly raised him, because she is a woman.
	- Pumpkin pie.
