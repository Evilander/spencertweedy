- The gamer kids shopping in the army surplus store, remarking excitedly at different clothing items.
	- The tiny blond chihuahua guarding the store.
- Kevin Morby and Katie Crutchfield performing at a totally packed coffee shop patio with a line around the block. The super cool abstract projections on the ceiling and PA, my favorite combinations of colors.
