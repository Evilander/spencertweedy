- How N95 masks and similar are (primarily) for protecting oneself, while surgical and cloth masks are (primarily) for protecting others — and what that means for “mask ethics.” (Surgical/cloth masks protect you, too, in that you help institute a social norm of mask-wearing when you wear them.)
	- Maciej Cegłowski in his essay “Let’s All Wear A Mask”: “Wearing [N95 masks] in daily life is like wearing a fireman’s coat instead of suntan lotion — it doesn’t do much for you, and wastes an invaluable resource that could save the life of a first responder.”
- Putting leftover lettuce from our Passover *seder* in the backyard for interloping rabbits to claim.
