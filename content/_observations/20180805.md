- Fitting my sleeping bag into the carrying sleeve on the first try, a task that used to take two or more desperate attempts.
- The bible study coffee shop advertising an “Everlasting Youth Initiative.”
- Re-realizing that there is no perfect run through life, no perfect career, no maximum potential to meet, and how soothing that is. It discourages some people from trying (*if I can’t “win,” what’s the point?*) but it encourages me, because it means that work is still worthwhile even if we miss some opportunities or if others are impossible to meet.
