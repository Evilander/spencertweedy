- Yet another [Anand Giridharadas idea](https://themariannewilliamsonpodcast.com/2020/11/04/episode-3-anand-giridharadas/){: .pol} that’s ringing in my mind: while everyone’s experience of pain is different — and we shouldn’t paper over those differences — there are pains that “rhyme” across class/race/life differences. Anand is (and I am) interested in finding ways to talk about rhyming pains and to build solidarity around them.
