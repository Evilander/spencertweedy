Hi!

Here’s the November edition of Observations, my monthly roundup of favorite posts from <a href="https://spencertweedy.com/observations">my daily list blog</a>. (If you’re not interested anymore, no problem  — <unsubscribe>unsubscribe instantly</unsubscribe>.)

I’m trying out a custom design this month, to match the website. If it looks weird in your email viewer, or if you find the new format annoying, please <a href="mailto:spencer@penguinmail.com?subject=Newsletter design">let me know</a> so I can adjust it.

Also: the <a href="https://observations.website/">Observations: Year One</a> paperback chapbook is almost sold out! If you don’t have a copy yet, you can <a href="https://observations.website/">buy one here</a>. Thank you to everyone who’s supported the book so far.

And thank you for reading. Here’s the roundup.

* Popping washed-up kelp pods on the beach in Santa Barbara. <a class="date-code" href="https://spencertweedy.com/observations/100419.html">10-4</a>
* Installing a new car battery with Mom on Instagram Live. <a class="date-code" href="https://spencertweedy.com/observations/101619.html">10-16</a>
* Walking with Mom and her Team Susan Miller Tweedy at the Light the Night Walk for Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. <a class="date-code" href="https://spencertweedy.com/observations/101919.html">10-19</a>

* The sold-out Cosmic Country Showcase at the Hideout. <a class="date-code" href="https://spencertweedy.com/observations/102519.html">10-25</a>
* Playing drums as Doug Clifford in Casey’s Creedence Clearwater Revival Halloween cover band. <a class="date-code" href="https://spencertweedy.com/observations/102919.html">10-29</a>

* Our snowy Halloween in Chicago. <a class="date-code" href="https://spencertweedy.com/observations/103119.html">10-31</a>
	* Hanging around a fire pit (which Mom masterfully lit) and handing out candy to trick-or-treaters with Mom, Casey, and Basil, who was wrapped in many blanket layers.
	* The big tree limb that fell into the street from the weight of snow, thankfully on no one and no cars.
* The type of knowledge that you can only find out in a Sim City-type setting: how many bugs you’ve ever unknowingly eaten, how many hours you’ve ever slept, the number of people who’ve stepped on a particular one-inch square, etcetera. I like imagining movie montages that reveal that type of info. <a class="date-code" href="https://spencertweedy.com/observations/103019.html">10-30</a>

* The bar patron talking about playing harmonica with the blues musicians in his hometown of Lansing, Michigan, but being excluded when he tries to sing with them (“so fucking cliquey, man”). So he moved to rural Illinois, “where the money is,” and he already feels like the blues guys in Chicago are friendlier. <a class="date-code" href="https://spencertweedy.com/observations/102419.html">10-24</a>
* The surprisingly poignant disposable camera photos of a 1998 furry convention on Flickr. <a class="date-code" href="https://spencertweedy.com/observations/102119.html">10-21</a>
* The full-grown coyote at the end of our block. <a class="date-code" href="https://spencertweedy.com/observations/102319.html">10-23</a>
