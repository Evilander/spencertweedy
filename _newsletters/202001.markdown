![A Christmas tree backstage at the Chicago Theater.](/uploads/IMG_0889-squashed.jpg)

Hi everybody,

This is a quick newsletter to say hi and happy New Year. I skipped the December newsletter, so in case you’ve forgotten, I’m [Spencer Tweedy](https://spencertweedy.com/), and this is the once-a-month roundup of posts from my blog, [Observations](https://spencertweedy.com/observations). If you want to leave the list for any reason, <unsubscribe>unsubscribe here</unsubscribe>, no problem.

I wanted to say thank you for reading Observations in 2019. Writing the blog, this newsletter, and self-publishing the first Observations book were some of my favorite things last year and I’m really grateful to all of you for reading, facilitating, making it feel worthwhile. I’m looking forward to lots more in 2020.

The [Year One](https://observations.website/) book is sold out online, but there are still eight or so copies at the non-profit [Secret Agent Supply](https://secretagentsupply.com/) in Chicago. I highly recommend visiting them, if not to buy Observations, then to see their other gifts and support the work that their parent, 826CHI, does for Chicago kids.

Thank you again and I hope your holidays are as fun and as stressless as they can be. ❤️

Spencer

## Observations

- The dump truck with a bunch of rubber flaps strung beneath it, like scales on a centipede’s underbelly. [11-18]
- The Orthodox Jewish man (with tzitzi) at a bar, dancing to house music, clapping on the downbeats. [11-30]
- Deliberately stepping on tortilla chips, which had spilled on the asphalt, for crunch-feel. [12-6]
- Asking a grocery store employee about Hanukkah candles and getting directed to a section of Virgin Mary devotional candles instead. [12-26]
- The sound tech with a Gretsch shirt, two Gretsch tattoos, and a son named Gretsch. [12-5]
- The blown-out speaker in a gas station pump ad TV sounding like the teacher in Charlie Brown. [12-10]
- The little hairs of mold in the tiny space between two wooden beams in a 118-year-old opera house bathroom — like stalactites. [12-6]
- Hearing “Take Me to the River” by Al Green for the first time since my Big Mouth Billy Bass childhood. [12-11]
- Using Neosporin (autocorrect: “bro’s potion”) that had expired in 2006. That is, vintage 2006. [12-7]
- Little geysers of clementine juice spraying on the car window while I peeled one. [12-4]
- The older man watching videos of trains on an iPad, in a booth in a diner. [11-21]
- How, in the din of noises from a huge construction site, you sometimes hear a few regular hammer hits, which makes me think: it’s amazing that anything so micro-level and unmechanized is part of building something so big. [12-5]
- Smelling a smell in Union Station that, for one super brief moment, seemed to change my entire experience of the world — like a whole new *feeling* of life in one second. It’s weird how smells can do that. [11-15]
- The delay between when hot water hits your hands and the pain of its heat. [12-17]
- The joy of sweeping up leaves indoors and knowing that you’re helping make the place cleaner, even if you don’t get every single leaf. [11-1]
- Rebecca Solnit in *Hope in the Dark*: “The apocalypse is always easier to imagine than the strange circuitous routes to what actually comes next.” [11-15]
- Sleeping with an external hard drive purring on my desk, backing up. [12-2]
- The license plate “JAZZMOM.” [12-17]
- The Christmas tree in the corner backstage, spooky-looking and beautiful. [12-18]
- Playing in Sima Cunningham’s Aux Thom New Year’s Eve party at Constellation. The funnest. [12-31]
