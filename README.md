## How It Works

Jekyll takes each file from 'pages', populates it with appropriate content from 'content', and processes it with the appropriate layout from '\_layouts'. Static assets such as CSS, fonts, and images are stored in 'assets', with the exception of post images, which are stored in the '\_uploads' directory in 'content' (so that Jekyll and Netlify CMS can treat it as a collection).
