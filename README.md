## Why Is This Repository Public?

I dunno. Just for fun! I reserve all the rights to the site and its content. But I think it’s fun to let people see how things work, if anyone is interested. Plus, I’m an amateur developer, so if you notice something you think I could improve, please tell me about it.

## How It Works

Jekyll takes each file from 'pages', populates it with appropriate content from 'content', and processes it with the appropriate layout from '\_layouts'. Static assets such as CSS, fonts, and images are stored in 'assets', with the exception of post images, which are stored in the '\_uploads' directory in 'content' (so that Jekyll and Netlify CMS can treat it as a collection).
