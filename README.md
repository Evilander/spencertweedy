## How It Works

Jekyll takes each file from 'pages', populates it with appropriate content from 'content', and processes it with the appropriate layout from '\_layouts'. Static assets such as CSS, fonts, and images are stored in 'assets', with the exception of post images, which are stored in the '\_uploads' directory in 'content' (this is so that '\_uploads' can be a Jekyll- and Netlify CMS-recognized collection).
