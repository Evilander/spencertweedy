- Going for a walk along the river with a friend, an activity I never imagined myself doing *on my own volition* as a kid but which feels like a vital part of mental healthcare today. How those little things feel more important to me now, even as a very young adult.
- The moss, looking abnormally oily and Nickelodeon slime-like just beneath the surface of the river.
- The contractor installing a light fixture on a bar patio wearing full Packers gear (athletic shorts, t-shirt) and drinking a Michelob Ultra.
- Hearing Mavis on the radio in a CVS.
