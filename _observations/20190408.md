- Getting smoked aioli on my sock.
- Turning on the hotel TV to find a sequence of a baby bird falling down the face of a cliff and somehow surviving.
- The faux Ancient Greek landscape in the backdrop of a Catholic TV interview show.
- How surprising, and heartening, it is to think about the overall relative stability of the world when it’s so easy to make mistakes with far-ish-reaching consequences (and how many people there are to make them). I think about this especially when I’m going to sleep at night and there aren’t any audible signs of bad decision-making or accidents to be heard near me (a basically useless test, but the one I have when I’m falling asleep). I know those things are happening *somewhere* (and in some places, they happen very often), but it’s a wonder that they aren’t happening *everywhere*.
