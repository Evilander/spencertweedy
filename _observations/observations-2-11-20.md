- The man with a MacBook charger trailing behind his backpack like a lizard tail.
- How talking about the past with a little condescension seems like a reasonable reward for being older, or compensation for missing the privileges of being young. (I try to accept whatever little condescension comes my way because I feel like if I were older, I would feel entitled to speak that way too.)
- The pleading look from a jazz drummer to a horn player at the end of a drum solo, asking them to return to the songâ€™s head.
