- How I thought I was above my wisdom tooth antibiotic’s “common side effect” of diarrhea. I was wrong.
- The hum of the fridge sounding exactly like “Adam+Eve Connection” by Deerhoof.
- FaceTiming Mom from the hot tub at our ridick Airbnb.
- The amazing footage of the Captain and Tennille on *The Midnight Special*.
- How some might accuse the Left of whataboutism by defending Rep. Tlaib’s use of “motherfucker” with evidence of Republicans’ use of profanity. But it would only be whataboutism if we believed profanity (in informal settings) is wrong and that we ought to direct people’s attention away from our own wrongdoing. We have no such belief. We like swearing (in informal settings) and we know that Republicans do, too. But they claim that they don’t and so we’re speaking out about their bad-faith arguments.
- Dave Davies following me on Twitter after I liked one of his tweets (?!)
