- This badass micro-nonfiction tweet from Pam Grier, Ph.D.: “In 1976, I placed Richard Pryor’s injured horse in the back seat of my 4 door Jaguar to take to the Vet. I drive down the 405 with Richard in the passenger seat wearing his bathrobe, Ginger his horse thinking I’m crazy, drivers following us, we saved her life that day.”
