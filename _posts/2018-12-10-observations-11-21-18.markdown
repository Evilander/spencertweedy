- Talking with Sammy about why the imagery/history/thought of WWII is so appealing for lots of present-day young people. We think it's because the war had cut-and-dried sides of good and bad (apart from all our nuanced judgments of the USâ€™s engagement) while we can hardly even figure out who (or what corporations) are to blame for the injustices we try to fight against today. For young people who are eager to *do work* on the world and help out, the prospect of a mortal battle against a known, openly destructive (as opposed to secretly destructive) force is a really romantic one. Plus the uniforms were normcore.
