- Learning the word “melliferous" (“yielding or producing honey”) by looking up whether a typo word was real (it wasn't).
- The percussion professor demonstrating a rhythm on my arms, accidentally slapping my flu shot site [10-29-18].
- Feeling inspired by Maciej Ceglowski. He runs Pinboard as a lightweight, one-person company whereas Delicious and similar sites of the past were multi-million-dollar, Yahoo-acquired behemoths (and they're not around anymore). And he founded Tech Solidarity, which is changing the way progressive candidates fund campaigns. He's funneling money from small donors on the internet to overlooked House seats that could have a huge impact on the midterms. (The DNC doesn't care about them because they're not in metropolitan districts, I guess.)
