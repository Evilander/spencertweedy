Went to see Kanye West and Jay Z at the United Center last night. The tickets were a Chanukah present for my inspiringly hip little brother, Sammy. He’s gotten super into rap this past year and had been begging my parents to go to this show for months. It became a sort of family joke for awhile because we thought it’d be hilarious for us, the Tweedys, dorky, Jewish, white folk, to go to a rap show. And, uh, it was. It was also a lot of fun, though. Crazy, foreign fun. If I were to break my impenetrable hipster guise of jadedness and superiority, I would even say that I really enjoy their music. Mostly Jay Z’s; Kanye is unique and talented, and seems to be some sort of a visionary, but ole Jigga’s tracks are raw (if rap can be raw). We had a good time.
