Photos from my family’s trip to Spain last summer. I had planned to post these along with a big recap of our amazing times there but then I went to camp and… school happened. Can’t believe this was almost a year ago.
Taken with a Yashica Ninja Star I bought while we were there.



I could not be happier with how beautifully my lil’ Ninja Star performed. It’s like a disposable on steroids.



It was a tour, after all…
