I usually go to Walgreens because they’re nearby and fast. That said, they suck. On some real levels. Almost every roll of color film I’ve given them has come out underexposed. One time, they snipped the negatives wrong and made mutant prints of my photos bleeded together. I’m not sure if this goes for all Walgreens, but in my experience, they are the equivalent of a photo-developing butt-nugget.
Last year I sent a roll of Kodachrome to Dwayne’s Photo in Kansas and I was very pleased. They’re slower and more expensive than Walgreens but I think that’s a worthy cost when it comes to precious, easily-screwed film.
