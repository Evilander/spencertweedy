All the time. All of it.

That is when we have been saying this. Painting it, writing it, singing it, thinking it. Every generation, we say, “What hath God wrought.” Life stinks! We are doomed. Things are not okay.



It’s comforting to think that we’ve always been saying that. For as long as we’ve been recording stuff, some schmuck in the village has kindly taken it upon himself to remind us, “What hath God wrought,” as if we weren’t all already thinking it to ourselves. (Now, we tweet it to ourselves.) The idea that the times we live in aren’t special, after all, is a nice one. But it’s easy to shoot holes through. It’s easy to think, “Wow, this time God really, really wrought it,” when you realize that, for the first time ever, humans have the ability to literally explode planet Earth.

We can explode Earth

I have a crap-ton of faith in humanity. We are really the freakin’ best. We do so much nasty stuff but, in the end, we’re the ones going to space. Dolphins are smart, kittens are cute, ants are strong and jellyfish can live forever … but I think it’s safe to say: we on this.

I really hope that we’re able to hold this thing together till somebody—my generation! The children!—comes along and handles it for the whole of us. It feels pretty obvious; it’s like when my brother and I were little and discovered that a pool noodle could be used to brutally whack each other in the face. Our parents took away the pool noodles. We argued, said we’ll put an end to the whacking, cried that we’ll use them solely as underwater horsies. But it wasn’t worth it. My parents knew that. Even if we can handle the power of the noodle, why risk it? Somebody needs to take away humanity’s pool noodles.

And that’s my contribution to global diplomacy. Israel, Iran, Russia, US, please don’t poop the bed.

I don’t know anything about art. (Except for what I think I know about art…) I saw Picasso’s “The Old Guitarist” on Liam Sarsfield’s blog today and thought it might be appropriate for this here matter.
