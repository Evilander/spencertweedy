My friend Miles has cancer. In a few weeks, he’ll fly to LA to undergo an operation that requires total isolation. 2,000 miles away from home, he won’t be able to see his family, or his friends, or anyone he knows. To help cope with that stress (let alone the stress of cancer itself), and to prove true the age-old saying, “Laughter is the best medicine,” Miles’ dad started a campaign, Jokes 4 Miles, to compile 5,000 jokes for Miles to watch and enjoy while in treatment. For something so easy for us to contribute to, it’s incredible how much it means to Miles. It gives him more than laughter; it gives him a sense of connectedness to other people at a time when he no doubt feels a loneliness even deeper than that from being so far away from home.

Here’s what we can do:

Submit! Record a video of yourself telling a joke, singing a song, performing a magic trick, showing off your cute pet, or whatever. If you think it will make Miles smile, go for it. More in-depth submission instructions are on the Jokes 4 Miles website.
Share! Tell your family, your friends, and strangers about Jokes 4 Miles. Send them to the website or the YouTube video. At the time I’m writing this, they still need 4,452 more jokes!
Hope! Hope your darnedest that Miles be healthy and stay healthy. Jokes 4 Miles →
