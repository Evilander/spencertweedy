I may be the whitest weenie you know but I love me some Beyoncé. I don’t care how “mainstream” she is or whatever (I/everyone should care how mainstream anyone is): her chords are freakin’ sonic gold.
This song is pretty amazing. I like the original-ish version, too—Pon De Floor by Major Lazer. Diplo seems to be a talented dude.
