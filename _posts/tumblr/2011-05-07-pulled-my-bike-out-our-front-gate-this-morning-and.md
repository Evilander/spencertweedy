Pulled my bike out our front gate this morning and came upon this cruel work of criminal ingenuity. It was one of those “wait… wut” moments where, for a second, I thought I was in the pilot episode of Justin Bieber’s new Punk’d. Until I went “wait… wut” again and progressed into, "I must hunt the anuses who did this.“
Several hours later, a truck came to pick it up. I say "pick it up” in its broadest sense, because what happened between that car being on the ground and on that flatbed was anything but picking—more like dragging. When a car doesn’t have wheels, it doesn’t move very well. Luckily, the tow-truck guy was really really nice and made sure no extra damage was done. He had to use wood blocks as slippers to make it sort of slide onto the truck. There are gashes in the asphalt under where the car was.
What a nice early Mother’s Day gift.
