Gorgeous mid-century modern type and meAlexPatrickI went to the Garfield Park Conservatory for the first time today. It’s so beautiful! These pictures don’t show it (try watching some of these) but it’s a gigantic, old building with several greenhouses, each of which houses hundreds of plants from various parts of the world. It’s hard to believe that it exists, like a labyrinth of a zillion tropical biomes hidden inside the city. It’s even harder to believe that it’s public and free to visit. It makes me proud of Chicago.
