The Blisters with Ben McKenzie from Ben McKenzieMy band, The Blisters, is in a Funny or Die video! With Ben McKenzie!
Earlier this year, our friend, Chris, who happens to be a screenwriter, approached us with the idea of making a Blisters comedy short… About a month later, a crew of five guys were in my basement with a tricked-out 5D and Hayden, Henry, and I were being viciously harassed by the guy on Southland.
Fun factoids about the filming!
Ben McKenzie put on baby oil before wrestling with us.
That’s it. Enjoy!
P.S. Please don’t judge Henry by his singing at the end. Because of some weird recording setup, he literally couldn’t hear himself at all. Also, Hayden’s last name is Holbert, not Halpert.
