My dad played a couple of songs at 826 Chicago’s “People Eating & Giving” fundraiser last night to raise money for free-of-charge writing workshops and tutoring. It was held at the University Club of Chicago which is the most insane, medieval-y building I’ve ever been in during a thunderstorm, let alone seen. It was also decently fancy, so, knowing my father, I had to google “how to tie a tie” in advance.
Speaking of my father and “in advance,” my dad is so accustomed to having a pick in his pocket at all times that when he wore a suit for the event, he forgot one and arrived pick-less. He had to start his mini-set by asking, “is there a pick in the house?”
Altogether, the event raised over $100,000 for 826 Chicago programs. I got to meet Dave Eggers.
