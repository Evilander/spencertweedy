title: 'In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come
  back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting
  lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with
  good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other
  side. Else, tomorrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what
  we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame
  our own opinion from another.'

In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. Else, tomorrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.—Ralph Waldo Emerson on art
Just starting to cover transcendentalism in my American literature class and it’s really interesting. I’m a full-fledged believer in modernism and innovation, but that doesn’t stop me from finding ole Ralph, Walt n’ Henry admirable and their work romantic. I love anything that helps me to better understand creativity.
