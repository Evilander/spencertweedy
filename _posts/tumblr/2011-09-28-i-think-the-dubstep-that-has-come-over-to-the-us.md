title: I think the dubstep that has come over to the US, and certain producers — who
  I can’t even be bothered naming — have definitely hit upon a sort of frat-boy market
  where there’s this macho-ism being reflected in the sounds and the way the music
  makes you feel. And to me, that is a million miles away from where dubstep started.
  It’s a million miles away from the ethos of it. It’s been influenced so much by
  electro and rave, into who can make the dirtiest, filthiest bass sound, almost like
  a pissing competition, and that’s not really necessary. And I just think that largely
  that is not going to appeal to women. I find that whole side of things to be pretty
  frustrating, because that is a direct misrepresentation of the sound as far as I’m
  concerned.

As someone who spent a month at sleep-away camp this summer, and therefore spent a month involuntarily listening to balls-out dubstep, all day, everyday, because Eminem, K''naan and Afroman aren’t good enough for white suburban Jews anymore, these words are golden. It’s a genre that has been royally shafted by the Jersey Shore sect of Amurrica and, while I’m not one to enjoy heavily electronic music in the first place, that’s a shame.
Speaking of James Blake, his new-ish record rules. If a man could ever use auto-tune in a beautiful fashion, it is he.
(For the record, I’m not suburban, I just go to camp with suburbans. I swear.)
