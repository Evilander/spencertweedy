The Blisters played our first show when we were seven years old. Now we’re seventeen/eighteen, and this spring, we made a record!

I’m so happy that we got to do this, and I really like what we made. We’re releasing it on June 4, just in time for a bunch of summer shows, including Solid Sound on June 23. I hope that you like it, and four squillion thank-you’s to Mark Greenberg and The Loft for making it happen!

(I’m the drummer.)
