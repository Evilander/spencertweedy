“Rosie Oh” — Animal Collective

I listened to Animal Collective’s new record, Centipede Hz, a few days ago. Its arrangements (credited mostly to Avey Tare?) are a little bit all-over-the-place, and I don’t mean that with snark; it’s clear that the digi-psychedelic collages’ lack of white-space is an artístic decision. In general, I vote for the other route—a distilled, rich heart, and only the frills that make the song stand upright—but I’m okay with overload as long as there’s a strong centerpiece to fall in love with, and what with the bittersweet changes and exotic rhythm on this record, there certainly is. I just need a breather when it’s finished.

This song is borderline ska in the best way I can think of.
