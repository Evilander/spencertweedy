Awhile ago, I talked about how my friend Alex and I would be selling t-shirts on the internet soon. That was two months ago, and today, I’m real excited to announce that Buck Tees is now open for business!

We’ve made no compromises when it comes to the quality of these shirts; they’re screen-printed by hand at a printer in our hometown, Chicago, Illinois, on comfy, 100% cotton tees. They’re adorned with some pretty weird, off-kilter, minimalist art (drawn by Alex). We think they’re really nice, and we hope you do, too.

To celebrate our long-awaited deliverance unto open-for-business-ness, all orders of two or more shirts get US shipping free! Things are gonna roll this way till Labor Day, and then we have plenty more discounts and promotions up our sleeves.

Here’s to craftsmanship, art, earnestness, and Buck Tees →
