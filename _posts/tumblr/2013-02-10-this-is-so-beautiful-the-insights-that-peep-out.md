This is so beautiful. The insights that peep out of little kids’ minds are nice because they remind us that we all have similar hearts. Also, they’re often more eloquent than any older turd could have imagined.

Common wisdoms don’t feel any less special to me; they make me excited, like each one is an underwater cave that many people have discovered. the Scared is scared reminded me of a cave I hadn’t visited for awhile, and showed it to me in a new light.
