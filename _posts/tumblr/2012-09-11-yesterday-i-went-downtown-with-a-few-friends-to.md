Yesterday, I went downtown with a few friends to support our teachers at their union strike rally. It was as peaceful and joyous as these kinds of things get; aside from a few vicious anti-Rahm signs, it was nothing but chanting and drum circling and walking and smiling. It was fun to be part of it, and we were glad to show our teachers how much we appreciate them. You can see the rest of the photos I took on my dusty Flickr.

Iâ€™m wary of any person or people that sway too far in any direction, but sometimes you have to sway far so that you can stop swaying in the future.
