Some favorites from the past couple months. ‘Favorites’ with an emphasis on “Listening To The Wind That Blows" because it’s one of those songs that’s so good, you feel like you’ve been hearing it all your life. Well, maybe I have been hearing it my whole life (or at least I heard it a bunch around the time it was being made, when I was a lil’ tyke), but when Mermaid Avenue 3 came out on Record Store Day last Saturday and I listened to it for the first-ish time, I was tickled.
