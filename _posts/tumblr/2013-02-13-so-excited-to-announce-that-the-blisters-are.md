So excited to announce that The Blisters are playing at Solid Sound Festival this year. It’s such a fun weekend, in such a beautiful place, with such nice people. I couldn’t wait to just be there, and now I can’t wait to play at it, too.

In case ya don’t know, The Blisters is the band that I play drums in. We’ve been together for 10 years and are looking to have a monstrous last hurrah before our college-induced indefinite hiatus. Aside from Solid Sound, we’re doing a Daytrotter session in May. More big news for us to come…
