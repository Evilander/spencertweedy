My friend Alex draws things. Earlier this year he made a badass centaur to be the sorta mascot of the band I play drums in, The Blisters. (You can see it here.) After that, we thought, why not start making t-shirts together? So we’re going to be making t-shirts together.

They’re not for sale yet; we won’t be able to get everything ordered and inked and dried and washed till later this summer. But in the meantime, we’d love for you to drop your email address in the lil’ box we’ve set up so that when our tees are ready to be feasted upon, you’ll be the first to know. We heartily thank you in advance.
