I promised a spirit—conjured via ouija board by Tavi Gevinson and Anna Fitzpatrick—that I’d write a song about him. I’m not going to make a self-deprecating modesty cocktail about it like I usually do, but I will say this: it’s a demo. It’s also about as close to a fully-written song I’ve ever gotten before… More to come soon.
