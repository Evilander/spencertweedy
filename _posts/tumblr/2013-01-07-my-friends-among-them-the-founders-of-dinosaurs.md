Alex, Phoebe, Jack (not pictured: Hugh). Note: Not my house.My friends (among them, the founders of Dinosaurs On Bicycles, the “peaceful and loving community for dinosaur enthusiasts with a penchant for cycling”) and I started a monthly tradition last weekend, where we make homemade pasta and eat it. I had no idea how fun it could be to quadruple the amount of time it usually takes to prepare your dinner (and to live tweet it, while you’re at it)! We’ve officially christened our fine culinary arts gang Nood Squad.

Happy New Year!
