From On Paradoxes:

Our access to information has created more paradoxes. We’ve made pieces of conflicting information more accessible than any other point in time. Unfortunately, we’ve mistaken cynicism as the tool we need to cope with this conflict of information. It seems much more healthy to me to accept that two pieces of contradicting information can both some how be true. It removes that default state of distrust, and displaces it with acknowledgement, respect and insight. Things aren’t black and white. They are gray. We’re gray.

I have a problem seeing gray sometimes.
