Pops Staples’ final album, Don’t Lose This, is out today. Getting to work on this with my dad was one of the most special things I’ve ever gotten to do. To play along with Pops’ voice and guitar alone was surreal; it felt like being in the room with someone whom I never got to meet. Thank you, Mavis Staples, for giving us the opportunity to make music with you and, now, with your dad.
