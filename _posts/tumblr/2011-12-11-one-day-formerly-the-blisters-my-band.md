“One Day” — {Formerly The Blisters}
My band recorded a song! Henry, our frontman, wrote/sings it. I play drums (and a dollop of mellotron strings and a tad of background vocals). We just “hired” a new kid to play with us, and we haven’t played any gigs in a really long time, so we’re still getting our act re-together, but it feels good to have something down finally. Gonna mail out a bunch of cassettes today.
P.S. The Blisters chapter has ended. What should we call ourselves?
