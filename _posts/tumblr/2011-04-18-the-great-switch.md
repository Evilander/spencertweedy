I moved my blog to Tumblr.
This has been one of the longest running, intense, vicious battles of my blogging career. From the moment I opened up my WordPress “child entrepreneur” site, I’ve always had trouble resisting the allure and ease of a tumblelog. Yesterday I gave in.
I’m 99% sure this is not nearly as big of a deal as my brain thinks it is, but it’s already confused some people (read: my mom) so I thought I’d write a proper Tumblr introduction. For the most-part, everything here is going to be the same, just plus some smaller, more frequent posts. A little while ago, I talked about how emotionally attached I am to this blog and how I’m trying to be okay with change. I think moving to Tumblr is the kind of change that will help me start blogging more.
The problem with WordPress is that I felt like I could only write long posts with it. With a high school-induced lack of time, this wasn’t always possible. Tumblr, on the other hand, feels like a perfect tool for both the teeny and the ginormous. That, combined with the “Following” feature (which only affects Tumblr users), was the final selling point. Having two blogs was also getting annoying.
Don’t worry, though (I say this to myself as much as to you). This is not going to turn into an interweb meme reblog center. Staying away from that stuff; only my posts (with maybe a few exceptions here and there). I know the RSS feed went a little haywire and has been sending out old reblogs but that should stop soon. I’m trying to keep this exactly like it was, plus smaller posts.
Hi, Tumblr.
P.S. Comments will be added soon.
