I’m all for the celebration of peace and, as controversial as it is, the death of a man who’s killed thousands, but crap like this makes me micro-vomit ten squillion times over. Sing the national anthem. Light candles, hold signs, heck, burn a picture or smash a piñata. But please, please don’t act like you’re at a goddamned frat party. Maybe, just maybe chant “USA, USA,” but fisting-pumping… Something about that fist-pumping.

This, on the other hand, rules. Hitler allusion feels weird but.. appropriate.
