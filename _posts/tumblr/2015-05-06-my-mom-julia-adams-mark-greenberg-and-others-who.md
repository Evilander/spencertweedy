My mom, Julia Adams, Mark Greenberg and others who helped run Lounge Ax during its too-short life announced today that they’ll be putting together a coffee table book to commemorate the venue, the bands that played there, and all the die-hard fans that spent every night from 1987 to 2000 in its smoky room (and every day since wishing it were still around). They’re starting the collection process now and would like to hear from anyone who has any pictures, flyers, posters, tickets, calendars, clippings, videotapes, stories—ANYTHING—related to Lounge Ax. If you’ve got somethin’, email them here: loungeaxbook@gmail.com.
