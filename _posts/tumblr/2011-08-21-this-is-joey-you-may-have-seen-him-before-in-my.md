This is Joey.
You may have seen him before in my pictures or videos. I frequently quote things that my brother says while conversing with him. He’s a sweet, Metallica-loving little boy.
He has glorious hair.
His school seems to think otherwise. More specifically, his school’s dress code seems to think otherwise. Instead of “glorious,” Joey’s school looks at his head of luscious locks as not a gem of humanity, but a discordance in uniformity.
We say nay to their nay. Joey’s hair is a gift. Not only to him, but to all those who enjoy it. To all those who enjoy looking at it. Caressing it. Being in the same room as it. Tell Joey’s school: requiring Joey to cut his hair is to deprive humanity of that gift. Please, don’t make Joey cut his hair. Please.
