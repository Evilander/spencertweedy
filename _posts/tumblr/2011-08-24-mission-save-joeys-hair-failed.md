A couple days ago I made a post about a petition against the dress code requiring my little brother’s best friend, Joey, to shear off his overgrown, oh-so tastefully styled locks.
For those of you that participated in the petition, or at least stood by, concernedly, I have some sad news.
Joey was forced to cut his hair yesterday evening. It is comparatively short yet still long enough to foster a comparatively less-awesome but magnificent nonetheless ‘do. He was able to have it cut to the bare minimum dress code requirement (so much so that it is a possibility he may be required to have it cut again).
Please know that your efforts were not fully in vain; Joey and his family enjoyed and are thankful for the work we did. If Joey’s hair had a conscious mind, I’m sure that it would be thankful, too. The amount of support our petition gathered in such short notice was not only a pleasant surprise but a deeply reassuring validation of the pain and anger all parties involved feel when this time of year comes around.
Thank you.
