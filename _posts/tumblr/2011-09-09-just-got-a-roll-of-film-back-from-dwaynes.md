Just got a roll of film back from Dwayne’s Photo that I took during Solid Sound this summer. I think these might be the first Leica shots that I didn’t take to Walgreens for developing/ruining/being puked on. They came out beautifully. DWAYNE’S 4 LYF.
I wish I took more pictures of the crazy things in Mass MoCA like this. It’s one of the biggest buildings I’ve ever seen… And so much of it is unrenovated, haunted, asbestos-filled vacancy. I’m pretty sure this “organ” is made out of old factory parts. And a prosthetic leg.
