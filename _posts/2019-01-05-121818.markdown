- Waking up early-ish for wisdom tooth surgery.
	- The pink sunrise.
	- Listening to morning radio and talking about Cardi B and Offset with my Lyft driver to Liam’s house (whence he drove me to surgery).
	- “Tell Me Something Good” on in the waiting room.
- Afterward, Casey tolerating my slurping while eating.
- The big piece of flesh that came out of one of my tooth sockets.
- Finding reassurance in the fact that the Stickies app is still on Mac.
