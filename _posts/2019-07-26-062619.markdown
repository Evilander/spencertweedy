- Getting picked up from the airport for Solid Sound Festival in a stretch limousine because, the driver said, it was the only car they had left.
	- “We usually only use this for funerals.”
	- Regarding the shaky ride: “It’s used to funeral speeds.”
	- Continuing his morbidity streak: he told me about a crash on our stretch of highway that occurred because another driving company had illegally welded their own stretch limo.
	- Him stopping for maple syrup at his favorite roadside syrup stand, and buying a little bottle for me.
	- Passing a beautiful mountain overlook: “It’d be nice if they cut some of these trees down; it’s a wonderful view.”
- The traffic cone truck with a divot in it so that a worker can stand upright and drop cones to the road more comfortably.
- The air conditioning unit with a name: “Mr. Slim.”
- There being so much dandelion fluff in the wind, it looked like snow.
