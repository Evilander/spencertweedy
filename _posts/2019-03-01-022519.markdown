- Finding out that my prolonged bout of diarrhea a few weeks ago was, in fact, salmonella [2-12-19].
- Skipping through an annoying section of an Art Ensemble of Chicago song (via Sammy) and feeling like I didn’t deserve the (more palatable) remainder of the song.
- At Zaid’s hospital room [[12-2-18](https://spencertweedy.com/observations/120218.html) et al.], listening to his stories about running a used car lot at age eighteen; buying a gas station just for the repair garage and making the gas so expensive that no one would buy it (so that they wouldn’t have to operate the pumps); the saga of trying to sell his patent for the world’s first cellular-connected burglar alarm.
	- Some people bought their expensive gas anyway, since, as Zaid learned, “some people really don’t give a shit.”
	- Zaid’s disdain for the exploitative asshole who got him into the business.
