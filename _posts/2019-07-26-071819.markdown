- Driving into the Menards lumber yard in a caravan of four fifteen-passenger vans and one box truck; buying all the mulch bags they had in stock; loading them by hand into the vans; dropping them in a nighttime operation into the mud of Union Park.
- How the abandoned-looking house in my neighborhood has stacks of empty jars in its windows, but none full of pee.
- A coworker’s cigarette ash flying onto my upper lip, and me, thinking it was a warm bug.
- Hearing phantom walkie-talkie chatter from the day’s walkie-talkie use as I fell asleep.
