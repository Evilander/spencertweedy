- Taking the Amtrak train home to Chicago, like a quaint little pioneer.
	- Passing a gravestone shop called Grieff’s.
	- Smelling a smell in Union Station that, for one super brief moment, seemed to change my entire experience of the world — like a whole new *feeling* of life in one second. It’s weird how smells can do that.
- Kim Gordon’s *No Home Record* and Mohammed Reza Mortazavi’s *Ritme Jaavdanegi* (thanks Billy-John).
- Rebecca Solnit in *Hope in the Dark*: “The apocalypse is always easier to imagine than the strange circuitous routes to what actually comes next.”
