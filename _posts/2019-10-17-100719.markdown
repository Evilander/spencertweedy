- The just-beginning-to-turn leaves on the drive from New York City to Maine.
- Passing a town called Tewksbury.
- The smell of First Mark brand hand soap reminding me of the smell of the IT person at my elementary school — with whom I used to talk about Linux.
- The dirty latex glove on the ground at a gas station in Connecticut.
- The black latex glove on the ground near Rory Ferreira’s store in Biddeford, Maine.
