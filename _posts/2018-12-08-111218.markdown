- Playing on Colbert (!).
	- The commemorative plaque on the reinforcement columns that were put in place before circus elephants appeared there, on the Ed Sullivan Show, in 1956.
	- Going full Uniqlo Canadian tuxedo.
	- Hopefully redeeming myself from the tantrum I threw ~17 years ago (age ~5), when Wilco was on David Letterman and I wasn't allowed to stay for the taping because I was too young.
	- The NYPD cop ordering our *one* lonely fan outside the stage door (after Hugh Jackman's gaggle had dispersed) to wait for us on the other side of the street, motioning about her to me as if to say, *This crazy lady!* And us, walking over to the other side of the street to meet her.
	- Watching our segment of the show at a bar in Brooklyn, where they don't normally turn the TV on, but where they did—with volume—because our friend Sam called ahead. :)
- Touring Sear Sound with Tom (!). Meeting Roberta.
