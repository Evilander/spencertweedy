- Eating my first non-stale Swedish Fish (thanks to my snack package from Aunt Debbie [10-1-18]).
- Drinking so much tea (~20 ounces, a lot for a lightweight like me) that the blood vessels in my ears caffeine-constricted and made my hearing quieter. Or at least thatâ€™s my theory.
- Eating a piece of Lou Malnati's pizza imported to Wisconsin (by me) from Chicago.
