- Voting.
- Looking up Phil Spector's mugshots and getting scared by them.
- The lyrics for "Broken Heart" by Skip Spence on Genius[.]com, which sickeningly transcribe "than" as "then.”
- Watching election results in the campus center among my peers.
	- The disappointment of Beto's loss.
	- The excitement of Scott Walker's loss (i.e. Tony Evers’ win).
	- Yay about J.B., but only half-yay.
	- Feeling grateful for the House and pissed, but unsurprised, about the Senate.
- Finding out from a shared iCloud calendar notification, “[name] funeral," that a neighbor had died.
- Watching and cringing as a white bar manager touched a black woman bartender's hair, bu feeling relieved that she seemed sincerely okay with it.
