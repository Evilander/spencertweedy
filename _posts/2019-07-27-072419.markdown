- Remembering the inescapable feeling of the heat last weekend (~115º heat index). I’m embarrassed to admit that when I’ve seen images and stories of the concentration camps in our country recently I’ve of course understood how unacceptable and miserable they are, but nonetheless thought, in the back of my mind, that I could “think my way out” of an experience like that if I found myself in one—that I could detach to let my body experience it while my mind went elsewhere. (Similarly to how a person without depression might ask a person *with* depression to snap out of it.) Our hot weekend in Chicago was nothing like that misery but it reminded me how little time and distance it takes to make comfort feel impossibly far away.
