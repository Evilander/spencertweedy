- Remembering the inescapable feeling of the heat last weekend (~115º index). When you’re comfortable, it’s easy to think that you could “think your way out” of discomfort like that, similarly to how a person without depression might wish a person *with* depression could snap out of it. But it takes very little time and distance to make comfort feel impossibly far away.
