- Voting in the Chicago mayoral runoff (and treasurer/aldermanic races).
- Renewing my Chicago library card with a less-than-friendly librarian, who happened to have an Eastern European accent.
- Eating a kiwi with the skin on it for the first time because my mom told me that apparently thatâ€™s allowed now.
- Casey using a battery-powered pore sucker/cleaner on my face.
