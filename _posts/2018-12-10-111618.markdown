- An absolutely cuckoo week:
	- The Colbert performance.
	- Dad's book release.
	- The Raccoonists’ Lagniappe Session release.
	- Norah Jones' track release.
	- Finishing college.
- The ridiculously huge bathroom in the basement floor of the school wellness center, and me, wondering whether it was the result of lazy architecture or some weird design need I don’t know about (enough space for a stretcher?).
- In the waiting room of the counseling wing, the sound of the water feature in the “mind spa" room next door.
- Overhearing a tech services employee: “I am so done with fonts."
- Our annual, ritual friends’ trip to Pizza Ranch.
- How somewhere along the way in college I stopped writing to the “sound" of the sentences in my head and started writing to the "sound" of the philosophy books and papers I was trying to emulate. It had generally good results in school but I think it will be good to get back to a less stilted, more flowy kind of writing, while hopefully retaining the rigor and logic and other skills I picked up there.
- A Writing note to self: Don't read back what you've written until the end of the sitting; just keep going. Reading back can be a form of procrastination. You tell yourself it's necessary for getting a bird's-eye view of the piece, but really it's a way of avoiding the hard mental work of finding the next step.
