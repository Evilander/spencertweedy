- A Valentine’s Day photo shoot for Basil.
	- Cutting out pink paper hearts to lay around his feet.
	- Getting one non-blurry shot.
- Cooking Avrom Farm bacon for Casey and me.
- The sound of feet on the dance floor heard from the bar’s basement.
- A video of the 1962 Grand Prix (via Justin Ouellette).
	- Afterward, watching highlights of the 2018 Grand Prix, and feeling surprised by the collaborative spirit of it. When one driver bumped another off the track (and made him flip a dozen times), the bumper radioed in to make sure the bumpee was okay. It seemed less like a competition and more like an experiment: what will these machines do?
	- Since the sport is so dangerous, they can’t afford to be hotheads. When their coaches (?) tell them to brake and exit immediately, they do.
