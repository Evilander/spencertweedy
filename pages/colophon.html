	<p>Gradually improving this website is like a <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/">worry stone</a>. I come back to it when I want to soothe myself with something comprehensible, puzzle-like, and expressive.</p>
	<p>I develop it “by hand” because it’s fun and because I want the cottage industry of the web to continue. The commercial internet has consolidated so much influence in the hands of so few. With open-source tools, small-tech businesses, and our own little dinky websites, I believe we can foster more constructive applications of the internet.</p>
	<p>My website’s underlying code and more information about the technologies it uses are on <a href="https://github.com/spencertweedy/spencertweedy.com">GitHub</a>.</p>
	<p>The typesetting is in flux. Right now the site is set in Times New Roman, <a href="https://www.scribbletone.com/typefaces/iso">ISO</a> by Scribble Tone, and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/jaf-facit">Facit</a> by Tim Ahrens at Just Another Foundry. The photo of me on the homepage is by <a href="http://www.sarahelizabethlarson.com/">Sarah Elizabeth Larson</a>. The drum icon is by <a href="https://thenounproject.com/icon/drum-135575/">Arthur Shlain</a> via The Noun Project. I use the <a href="https://nova.app">Nova code editor</a> on macOS.</p>
	<p>Along this journey of homegrown website cooking, I’m inspired by <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/">Robin Sloan</a>, <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/what-screens-want/">Frank Chimero</a>, <a href="https://jessicahische.is/">Jessica Hische</a>, <a href="https://owltastic.com/">Meagan Fisher Couldwell</a>, <a href="https://craigmod.com/">Craig Mod</a>, <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/">Mandy Brown</a>, <a href="https://dansinker.com/">Dan Sinker</a>, and countless others who informed my ideas about the web as a teen in the late aughts and early 2010s.</p>
