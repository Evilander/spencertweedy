	<p>Gradually improving this website is like rubbing a <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/">worry stone</a>. I come back to it when I need to soothe myself with something comprehensible, puzzle-like, and expressive.</p>
	<p>The website’s source code and more information about the technologies it uses are on <a href="https://github.com/spencertweedy/spencertweedy.com">GitHub</a>.</p>
	<p>The pixel-y typeface seen on the homepage is <a href="https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/degheest/">FT88 Italic</a> by Ange Degheest and Velvetyne. The rest of the text is set in <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/jaf-facit">Facit</a> by Tim Ahrens at Just Another Foundry. The drum icon is by <a href="https://thenounproject.com/icon/drum-135575/">Arthur Shlain</a> via The Noun Project. I use the <a href="https://nova.app">Nova code editor</a> on macOS.</p>
	<p>Along this journey of homegrown website cooking, I’m inspired by <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/">Robin Sloan</a>, <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/what-screens-want/">Frank Chimero</a>, <a href="https://jessicahische.is/">Jessica Hische</a>, <a href="https://craigmod.com/">Craig Mod</a>, <a href="https://dansinker.com/">Dan Sinker</a>, and countless others who informed my ideas about the web as a teen in the late aughts and early 2010s.</p>
