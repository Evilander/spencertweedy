### Flickr
I used to make photos pretty often. (I like the verb “make” rather than “take” for photography, like [Noah Kalina](https://noahkalina.com/newsletter-archive).) Some of my favorite photos exist in my [Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tweedyson/). ([This one](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tweedyson/7977682321/), of a Chicago Public Schools teacher on strike, sticks out in my memory.)

### Square Eye
In 2011 I published a book of some square-cropped photos called [*Square Eye*](https://www.blurb.com/b/2115788-square-eye).

### Videos
I’ve also made a small number of music videos (“[Whole Love](https://vimeo.com/28487755)”) and little scenes. They’re on my [Vimeo account](https://vimeo.com/spencertweedy).

One day I might try to dig up the RC boat “commercial” I made as a kid, or the claymation/stopmotion music videos ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I made [this ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpdUxP-FnNs) to promote my cotton-covered microphone cable project, starring my grandfather, Peter “Zaid” Miller. I love the video and I love Zaid.
