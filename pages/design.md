### Web design
I taught myself to write HTML and CSS when I was fifteen or so, during the huge bloom of in-browser creativity enabled by web typography and CSS3 styling tools. The global community of independent web designers was flourishing at that time and I looked up to people like [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com), [Meagan Fisher](https://owltastic.com), [Justin Ouellette](https://jstn.net), and [Jessica Hische](https://jessicahische.is), just to name a few. I immersed myself in their blog posts and portfolios and felt like a part of their professional world from afar, even though I was a high schooler in Chicago and they were working adults mostly based in Brooklyn. I did my first paying web design gig at that time, for [Andrew Wilkinson](https://www.metalab.com)’s then-new Tumblr theme business, [Pixel Union](https://pixelunion.net). (Andrew and his brother [William](https://williamwilkinson.com) held my hand throughout the whole process.) To this day, I occasionally do freelance design and development work, most often for [KC Tenants](https://kctenants.org), an influential Kansas City tenant union, and [People’s Action](https://damnhighrent.com), a national progressive advocacy organization.

### Fjord Audio
In 2016, I founded an audio equipment company, [Fjord Audio](https://fjordaudio.com). I launched the company with a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spencertweedy/fjord-xlr-classic-microphone-cables) for its first (and still-only) product, Fjord XLR, cotton-covered microphone cables. The company was my effort to combine my interests in design and recording. I had been dreaming about designs for consoles, studio furniture, preamps, and compressors. Starting with an accessory, microphone cables, seemed like a more feasible first step into that world. The Kickstarter campaign was a success (partly thanks to my zaide’s excellent [salesmanship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpdUxP-FnNs)) and we sold over 400 Fjord XLR cables. I found that the time required to manage the production process of the cables was more than I could keep up with at least as long as I was working on other projects, so I’m not actively making Fjord Audio products. I’d love to try to achieve one of those other, more complicated ideas someday, though.

### Sculpture
I took a sculpture class in college and I loved it so much. I’m still trying to figure out how to make sculpture a part of my life. I created three pieces for that class: [*Drumcalf Filet*]({% link pages/sculpture/drumcalf-filet/drumcalf-filet.md %}), [*Mobile Home*]({% link pages/sculpture/mobile-home/mobile-home.md %}), and [*Love Circuit*]({% link pages/sculpture/love-circuit/love-circuit.md %}). My instructor, [Rob Neilson](https://www.robneilson.com), was and is a great teacher.

### Chicago Service Relief
When bars and restaurants shut down because of the COVID pandemic, fundraisers for their staff and owners flooded social media. I was concerned that the overwhelming pace and volume of fundraising links would cause people to shut down and not give at all, so I created a web directory of Chicago bar and restaurant fundraisers called [Chicago Service Relief](https://chicagoservicerelief.com). After my initial roundup of fundraisers, owners and patrons submitted more, ending up with a total of 793 entries, as well as links to resources for out-of-work workers and artists. The website was covered by local news outlets, listed in the City of Chicago’s official resource list, and seen by thousands. How much money it helped direct toward establishments and their staff, I have no idea. I hope it was a lot! A few weeks after the launch of the website, Bob Orchard of the GatsbyJS project [generalized my code](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2020-03-26-service-relief-project/) so that people in other cities could launch their own directories. Other people created sites for Seattle, Denver, Austin, Sioux Falls, and Asheville.

### Direct Mail Activism
In the throes of Trump’s presidency I carried out an experiment in direct mail political mailings. I designed a working class solidarity postcard, picked the most homogenously white ZIP code in Illinois, and sent it to five hundred households. The postcard listed a Twilio phone number which would respond to incoming text messages with an onboarding script. I viewed the project as a failure. Perhaps only one or two households responded to the mailing’s call to action. I knew, going into the project, that I lacked the experience and training of professional political actors. I still appreciated taking a shot at a campaign of my own. And I’m still most interested in the work that targets “negative threes,” the least likely voters to come over to your platform.

### Buck Tees
In high school I ran a graphic t-shirt company with my friend Alex Kritikos. Alex designed the shirts and I got them printed with a local printer and designed a website for them. We sold about a hundred shirts over the lifetime of the project, mostly to our classmates. From the project I learned to put the horse in front of the cart; though a hundred sales should have been enough to make the project turn a profit, we ended up with a loss because I had purchased stickers, stamps, and postcards to include in our packaging, believing that a full, impressive unboxing experience was necessary for our success. It was fun. I enjoyed building off-the-wall, unusual ways of browsing our shirts online.

### Miscellaneous web projects
[Skyscraping]({% link pages/features/skyscraping.html %}), a pure-HTML-and-CSS city scene. [Sol LeWitt’s Canvas]({% link pages/features/lewitt.html %}), an HTML canvas experiment inspired by Sol LeWitt’s wall drawing style. Sammy’s Prints, a custom Shopify theme (and speculative, never-finished back-end for fulfilling customers’ orders via print-on-demand APIs) for my brother’s photography. Polysong, a songwriting companion app built for recording multiple snippets or versions of the same composition, unreleased.
