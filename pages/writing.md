### This website
From ages twelve to sixteen, I blogged on this website. Writing here was a huge part of my life. It introduced me to new friends and Wilco fans all over the world and gave me a creative outlet during an otherwise fraught time (adolescence). I let my hosting account lapse at one point and most of those posts were lost, but I suspect they lurk somewhere on my archival hard drives or maybe on the Internet Wayback Machine.

### Mirror Sound
In 2020, I co-created [Mirror Sound](https://mirrorsoundbook.com) with Lawrence Azerrad and Daniel Topete. The book is a look at the people and processes behind self-recorded music, a special kind of art that I love. We traveled around the country interviewing and photographing artists including Emitt Rhodes, Yuka Honda, Suzanne Ciani, and a zillion more. Our dream for the book is to inspire someone (you?!) to record, or to make whatever art they want to make, on their own terms. It’s less daunting than it might seem, even without the advantages many of these artists and I have.

### My college essay?!
I wrote [an essay]({% link _uploads/Common App essay.pdf %}) [PDF] to get into college that I still kind of enjoy because it conveys how much my mom’s former bar, Lounge Ax, means to me.

### Rookie Magazine
When my blogging friend Tavi Gevinson started her internet magazine, Rookie, I wrote [a few essays](https://www.rookiemag.com/author/spencertweedy/) for them.

### Talkhouse
I’ve written a few album reviews and essays for [Talkhouse](https://www.talkhouse.com/artist/spencer-tweedy/), but I don’t stand by everything in them! Especially my Neil Young slander. I loved Neil then and I still love him now, but I let my hunger for a catchy opening line get the best of me.

### Ray Seebeck books
In 2021, my childhood best friend Ray Seebeck and I collaborated on a quasi-children’s book called [*Multipurpose Friends*](https://www.blurb.com/b/10647584-multipurpose-friends). I’ve also contributed poems to Ray's publications [*Anthology*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RM8GCDS?ref_=pe_3052080_397514860) and [*Magazine*](https://magazinethemagazine.wordpress.com/).

### Square Eye
In 2011, when I was sixteen, I published [*Square Eye*](https://www.blurb.com/b/2115788-square-eye), a book of photographs. (No writing to speak of in it, but it’s a publishing project!)

### Observations
Lately, my main writing focus is the daily list blog [Observations]({% link pages/observations/index.html %}), which I started in 2018. In 2020, I published the first chapbook based on *Observations*, [*Year One*]({% link pages/observations/books/year-one.html %}), in a sold-out edition of 250.

### Other stuff
When I was a preteen, back in those blogging days, I also had a French toast review blog (With Butter and Syrup), a tech site/blog (Macatron), and any number of short-lived little experiments. The internet was/is/can be/should be fun.
