    <p>Take a bar, take 8 bars, take 16, 32… jump around and find something to loop, or use the whole track. Sing on it, rap, play bass, blow a jug. Slow it down, speed it up, chop, process, distort.</p>

        <p>The world’s sense of rhythm is continually enriched by people in sub-Saharan Africa and the African diaspora. I wouldn’t really know what to do with a drum if it weren’t for their singing (in voice and on drums) — often stolen, often shared in joy. I thank them.</p>
