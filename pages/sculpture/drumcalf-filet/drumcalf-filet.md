Prompted by my instructor Rob Neilson to incorporate a body mold into a piece, I cast my right calf in plaster and presented it as a filet of meat.

> It seems like parts of our bodies are differently meaningful to us depending on the work we do. As a drummer, my right calf is a particularly important part of my body because it helps move my right foot, which I use to press a kick drum pedal. Without an adequately built-up right calf, I wouldn’t be able to press the kick drum pedal in the right way — i.e. with enough stamina — and so I wouldn’t be able to accomplish the sounds on the instrument that I want to accomplish.

> A plaster cast of a calf is virtually unrecognizable as a calf on its own, so I sought to add other elements that would both expose and distort its being a calf. It is a meaty part of the body — all flesh, no bone — so it sort of resembles a slab of meat. In order to eke out that similarity, I placed the calf on a cast of a styrofoam meat tray and gave it a label modeled after the thermal printed stickers seen on deli meat products. This ended up not only making the calf more recognizable, but also giving it a new story. Instead of being a muscle that I use to play the drums, it became a muscle that someone would eat. If music is partly something we do in service of other people, then it seemed to raise the question: Is the flesh more useful to others when it’s helping to make music, or is it more useful when it’s helping to feed them? I imagine that the answer probably depends on how hungry the others are.
