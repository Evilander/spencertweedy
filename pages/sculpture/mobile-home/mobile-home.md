*2018. Cardboard, hot glue.*

![An image of my sculpture, Mobile Home.]({% link pages/sculpture/mobile-home/spencer_chair.jpg %})

Prompted to create a representational piece out of cardboard.

> This piece is a representation of the miniature chair that I sat in almost every day as a kid, roughly from ages three to six. I would sit in it, in our family room, and watch Nickelodeon cartoons during almost all of my free time. I only left this chair to take walks in the park, which my babysitters forced me to do, and to sleep. I’m pretty sure that, at some point, I defecated in this chair. It was my mobile home.
> 
> The chair is significant to me not only as an object with which I interacted almost every day, but also because of what it facilitated: TV-watching. I watched so much TV as a kid that during an admissions interview at a private school when I was five, I told administrators that it was my favorite thing to do. My parents were horrified (I got admitted anyway), but today, I don’t think of that early consumption as having rotted my brain. I look at it as my introduction to a world of images, language, aesthetic training, and moral theory. Even advertisements taught me about communication and bullshit. I don’t mean to say that I grasped all of those things at the time, but I appreciate them now.

> With this piece I intended to represent the chair accurately and true to scale, since its original miniature size is more meaningful to me than an enlarged or even smaller version would be. I think the piece succeeds in those goals apart from the legs, which differ significantly from the original. My greatest challenge was to represent the texture of the chair’s corduroy upholstery, which I dumbed down to eight buttons. The biggest failure of the piece is the lack of a distortion of the object’s form (apart from scale). I regret not having done something — such as lengthening the legs, so it stands too tall for a child to use! — that would have added to the object’s meaning.
