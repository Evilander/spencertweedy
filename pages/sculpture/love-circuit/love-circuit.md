> This piece is a representation of the feeling of (1) wanting to give something but having nothing to give and (2) wanting to give something but having no one to receive it. The lower bowl in the piece is offset from the upper bowl in such a way that it can’t achieve its goal. The upper bowl has no material with which to achieve its goal in the first place. Each bowl is made up of layers signifying the way that personalities are partly built up over time through sedimentation and the incorporation of lots of disparate experiences. (It also resembles the way a tree gains its rings.) The bowls are equal in diameter, signifying their equal capacity to achieve their goals if only they found themselves in the right circumstances (i.e. with the right material in the upper’s case and at the right level in the lower’s case). While the bowls are separated and frustrated in their goals at the top, they’re ultimately connected at the base of the piece, which signifies the indirect or sometimes invisible ways that we’re connected even when we can’t reach the person whom we intend to reach.
