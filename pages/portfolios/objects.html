	<p>I love the <em>processes</em> of making tangible things with wood, electronics, metal, and whatever else. It feels like a superpower to be able to realize your visions in material. My experience and skills are still very limited. These are some of the design and sculpture projects I hone them on.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Fjord Audio</h2>
	<p>In 2018 I ran a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spencertweedy/fjord-xlr-classic-microphone-cables">Kickstarter campaign</a> to create cotton-covered microphone cables in collaboration with <a href="https://conwaygoods.com">Conway Electric</a>. The campaign succeeded and I delivered more than 400 cables to studios and producers around the country. I designed the product and all of its marketing and packaging materials.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">The Pocket</h2>	
	<p>I co-own a recording studio and workshop in Northwest Chicago where my studio partner Jason and I fabricate custom studio desks and furniture. Below is a studio desk in progress, featuring custom aluminum supports and solid oak surfaces. We also restored the building’s 1967 feature wall, seen in the background.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Love Circuit</h2>
	<p>I created this piece as a student under <a href="https://www.robneilson.com">Rob Neilson</a>.</p>

		<p>This piece is a representation of the feeling of (1) wanting to give something but having nothing to give and (2) wanting to give something but having no one to receive it … Each bowl is made up of layers signifying the way that personalities are partly built up over time through sedimentation and the incorporation of lots of disparate experiences … While the bowls are separated and frustrated in their goals at the top, they’re ultimately connected at the base of the piece, which signifies the indirect or sometimes invisible ways that we’re connected even when we can’t reach the person we intend to reach.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Drumcalf Filet</h2>
	<p>Prompted by instructor Rob Neilson to incorporate a body mold into a piece, I cast my right calf in plaster and presented it as a filet of meat.</p>
	<div class="gallery -mx-[5vw]">
		<img src="{% link pages/portfolios/images/sculpture/drumcalf-filet/spencer_calf_2.jpg %}" alt="">

	<blockquote class="italic">
		<p>It seems like parts of our bodies are differently meaningful to us depending on the work we do. As a drummer, my right calf is a particularly important part of my body because it helps move my right foot with which I press the kick drum pedal … A plaster cast of a calf is virtually unrecognizable as a calf on its own, so I sought to add other elements that would both expose and distort its being a calf … If music is partly something we do in service of other people, then it seemed to raise the question: Is the flesh more useful to others when it’s helping to make music, or is it more useful when it’s helping to feed them? I imagine that the answer probably depends on how hungry the others are.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Mobile Home</h2>
	<p>Prompted to create a representational piece out of cardboard.</p>
	<img src="{% link pages/portfolios/images/sculpture/mobile-home/spencer_chair.jpg %}" class="picture w-full max-w-screen-sm" alt="">
	<blockquote class="italic">
		<p>This piece is a representation of the miniature chair that I sat in almost every day as a kid, roughly from ages three to six. I would sit in it, in our family room, and watch Nickelodeon cartoons during almost all of my free time. I only left this chair when forced by babysitters to take walks in the park, and to sleep. I’m pretty sure that, at some point, I shat in this chair. It was my mobile home.</p>
