	<p>I love the <em>processes</em> of making tangible things with wood, electronics, metal, and whatever else. It feels like a superpower to be able to realize your visions in material. My experience and skills are still very limited. These are some of the design and sculpture projects I hone them on.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Fjord Audio</h2>
	<p>In 2018 I ran a Kickstarter campaign to create cotton-covered microphone cables in collaboration with <a href="https://conwaygoods.com">Conway Electric</a>. The campaign succeeded and I delivered more than 400 cables to studios and producers around the country. I designed the product and all of its marketing and packaging materials.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">The Pocket</h2>	
	<p>I co-own a recording studio and workshop in Northwest Chicago where my studio partner Jason and I fabricate custom studio desks and furniture. Below is a studio desk in progress, featuring custom aluminum supports and solid oak surfaces. We also restored the building’s 1967 feature wall, seen in the background.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Love Circuit</h2>
	<p>I created this piece as a student under <a href="https://www.robneilson.com">Rob Neilson</a>.</p>

		<p>This piece is a representation of the feeling of (1) wanting to give something but having nothing to give and (2) wanting to give something but having no one to receive it. The lower bowl in the piece is offset from the upper bowl in such a way that it can’t achieve its goal. The upper bowl has no material with which to achieve its goal in the first place. Each bowl is made up of layers signifying the way that personalities are partly built up over time through sedimentation and the incorporation of lots of disparate experiences. (It also resembles the way a tree gains its rings.) The bowls are equal in diameter, signifying their equal capacity to achieve their goals if only they found themselves in the right circumstances (i.e. with the right material in the upper’s case and at the right level in the lower’s case). While the bowls are separated and frustrated in their goals at the top, they’re ultimately connected at the base of the piece, which signifies the indirect or sometimes invisible ways that we’re connected even when we can’t reach the person we intend to reach.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Drumcalf Filet</h2>
	<p>Prompted by instructor Rob Neilson to incorporate a body mold into a piece, I cast my right calf in plaster and presented it as a filet of meat.</p>
	<div class="gallery -mx-[5vw]">
		<img src="{% link pages/portfolios/images/sculpture/drumcalf-filet/spencer_calf_1.jpg %}" alt="">
		<img src="{% link pages/portfolios/images/sculpture/drumcalf-filet/spencer_calf_2.jpg %}" alt="">

	</div>
	<blockquote>
		<p>It seems like parts of our bodies are differently meaningful to us depending on the work we do. As a drummer, my right calf is a particularly important part of my body because it helps move my right foot with which I press the kick drum pedal. Without an adequately built-up right calf, I wouldn’t be able to press the kick drum pedal in the right way — i.e. with enough stamina — and so I wouldn’t be able to accomplish the sounds on the instrument that I want to accomplish.</p>
		<p>A plaster cast of a calf is virtually unrecognizable as a calf on its own, so I sought to add other elements that would both expose and distort its being a calf. It is a meaty part of the body — all flesh, no bone — so it sort of resembles a slab of meat. In order to eke out that similarity, I placed the calf on a cast of a styrofoam meat tray and gave it a label modeled after the thermal printed stickers seen on deli meat products. This ended up not only making the calf more recognizable, but also giving it a new story. Instead of being a muscle that I use to play the drums, it became a muscle that someone would eat. If music is partly something we do in service of other people, then it seemed to raise the question: Is the flesh more useful to others when it’s helping to make music, or is it more useful when it’s helping to feed them? I imagine that the answer probably depends on how hungry the others are.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Mobile Home</h2>
	<p>Prompted to create a representational piece out of cardboard.</p>
	<img src="{% link pages/portfolios/images/sculpture/mobile-home/spencer_chair.jpg %}" class="picture w-full max-w-screen-sm" alt="">
	<blockquote>
		<p>This piece is a representation of the miniature chair that I sat in almost every day as a kid, roughly from ages three to six. I would sit in it, in our family room, and watch Nickelodeon cartoons during almost all of my free time. I only left this chair to take walks in the park, which my babysitters forced me to do, and to sleep. I’m pretty sure that, at some point, I defecated in this chair. It was my mobile home.</p>
		<p>The chair is significant to me not only as an object with which I interacted almost every day, but also because of what it facilitated: TV-watching. I watched so much TV as a kid that during an admissions interview at a private school when I was five, I told administrators that it was my favorite thing to do. My parents were horrified (I got admitted anyway), but today, I don’t think of that early consumption as having rotted my brain. I look at it as my introduction to a world of images, language, aesthetic training, and moral theory. Even advertisements taught me about communication and bullshit. I don’t mean to say that I grasped all of those things at the time, but I appreciate them now.</p>
		<p>With this piece I intended to represent the chair accurately and true to scale, since its original miniature size is more meaningful to me than an enlarged or even smaller version would be. I think the piece succeeds in those goals apart from the legs, which differ significantly from the original. My greatest challenge was to represent the texture of the chair’s corduroy upholstery, which I dumbed down to eight buttons. The biggest failure of the piece is the lack of a distortion of the object’s form (apart from scale). I regret not having done something — such as lengthening the legs, so it stands too tall for a child to use! — that would have added to the object’s meaning.</p>
