## Observations is a daily list blog <br>by [Spencer Tweedy]({{ site.url }}).

In July 2018, I was working at a music festival in Union Park, Chicago, when a person with life-changing steez walked by. He was wearing an all-brown outfit (broutfit), had a handlebar mustache, was eating a submarine sandwich, and most importantly — most amazingly — he was eating whole dill pickles out of a ziplock bag. A bag that contained several pickle wholes. This was a serious pickle-eater, on the go, taking his pickle stash with him.

I was so excited by the dill devotee’s schtick I felt like I had to write about him. [So I did]({% link _observations/20180717.md %}). And then I wrote about the rest of my day, and the day after that, and the day after that, and I haven’t stopped since.

I was grateful to have a reason to blog again. I wrote on my website from ages twelve to sixteen and it was one of the most formative experiences of my life. Through blogging I met friends and strangers (mostly Wilco fans!) whose encouragement buoyed me through adolescence. At some point, sharing so much on the internet started to feel weird, and personal blogs fell out of style, so I stopped blogging, but I always missed it. And it took this bullet-pointy way of writing, and the Pickle Man in the Park, to help me start again.
