## Observations is a daily list blog <br>by [Spencer Tweedy]({{ site.url }}).

In July 2018, I was working at Union Park in Chicago when a person with unbelievable steez walked by. He had an all-brown outfit (broutfit); a handlebar mustache; a submarine sandwich in one hand; and, crucially, a ziplock bag of whole dill pickles in the other. Like he had to stock up on pickles for his stroll through the park.

I was so amazed by his schtick I felt like I had to document it. [So I did]({% link _observations/20180717.md %}). Then I wrote about the rest of my day, and the day after that, and after that, and I [haven’t stopped since]({% link pages/observations/archive.html %} "The Observations archive").

Since then, I’ve published a [chapbook]({% link pages/observations/books/year-one.html %}) compiling my favorite entries from the first year of the blog and created a [paper receipt series](https://instagram.com/{{ site.obs_instagram }} "Observations on Instagram").

Publishing Observations scratches an old itch for me. From ages twelve to sixteen I blogged about my life and ended up making friends as far away as New Zealand. Having a small audience (made up mostly of Wilco fans!) at a young age influenced the way I saw myself and what I thought was possible in the world, in mostly positive ways. But at some point, social media and growing up made blogging feel weird. It took Observations’ bullet-pointy format — and the Pickle Man — to make it feel fun again.
