## Observations is a daily list blog <br>by [Spencer Tweedy]({{ site.url }}).

In July 2018, I was at a park in Chicago when a person with life-changing steez walked by: all-brown outfit (broutfit), handlebar mustache, submarine sandwich in one hand and ziplock bag of whole dill pickles in the other.

I was so amazed by his schtick I felt like I had to write about him. [So I did]({% link _observations/20180717.md %}). Then I wrote about the rest of my day, and the day after that, and after that, and I [haven’t stopped since]({% link pages/observations/archive.html %} "The Observations archive"). That’s how the blog was born.

It was a return to the bloglife for me. From ages twelve to sixteen I wrote on my website and made friends as far away as New Zealand. It became one of the most important things in my life and gave me a sense of connection that carried me through adolescence. But at some point, blogging started to feel weird — because of social media, because of growing up — and I stopped. It took this bullet-pointy format — and the Pickle Man — to make it feel fun again. Thank you, Pickle Man.
