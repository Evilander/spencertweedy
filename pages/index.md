Hi! I play drums and [make records]({% link pages/releases.html %}) in Chicago.

Other projects:

* <a href="{% link pages/observations/index.html %}" class="with-icon observations-link">Observations</a>, a daily list blog
* <a href="https://mirrorsoundbook.com/" style="color: hsl(295, 59%, 60%);"><em>Mirror Sound</em></a>, a book about musicians who self-record
* <a href="https://thetweedyshow.com/" style="color: rgb(75,173,233);">The Tweedy Show</a>, my family’s livestream show
* <a href="https://fjordaudio.com/" class="with-icon fjord-link">Fjord Audio</a>, an audio equipment company

I have a [monthly newsletter]({% link pages/observations/subscribe.md %}) if you want to keep up with what I’m up to. I usually announce shows on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/{{ site.instagram }}) too.

Thank you ☺&#xFE0E;
