Hi! I play drums and help make [records]({% link pages/releases.html %}) in Chicago.

<a href="https://jefftweedy.bandcamp.com/album/love-is-the-king"><em>Love Is The King</em></a>, an album by my dad, is out on October 23.

<a href="https://mirrorsoundbook.com/" style="color: hsl(295, 59%, 60%);"><em>Mirror Sound</em></a>, a book about musicians who self-record by Lawrence Azerrad, Daniel Topete, and me, is out on October 20.

<a href="https://thetweedyshow.com/" style="color: rgb(75,173,233);">The Tweedy Show</a> is my family’s livestream show, broadcasted from our living room since the start of quarantine.

I also write a daily list blog, <a href="{% link pages/observations/index.html %}" class="with-icon observations-link">Observations</a>, and run a tiny audio equipment company, <a href="https://fjordaudio.com/" class="with-icon fjord-link">Fjord Audio</a>.

You can sign up for my monthly [newsletter]({% link pages/observations/subscribe.md %}), follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}">Twitter</a>, or follow me on <a href="https://instagram.com/{{ site.instagram }}">Instagram</a>.

Thank you ☺&#xFE0E;
