Hi! I play drums and help [make records]({% link pages/releases.html %}) in Chicago. Most recently: <a href="https://jefftweedy.bandcamp.com/album/love-is-the-king"><em>Love Is The King</em></a> with my dad.

I co-created a book with Lawrence Azerrad and Daniel Topete, <a href="https://mirrorsoundbook.com/" style="color: hsl(295, 59%, 60%);"><em>Mirror Sound</em></a>, about musicians who self-record.

<a href="https://thetweedyshow.com/" style="color: rgb(75,173,233);">The Tweedy Show</a> is my family’s livestream show, broadcasted several nights a week.

<a href="{% link pages/observations/index.html %}" class="with-icon observations-link">Observations</a> is my daily list blog. <a href="https://fjordaudio.com/" class="with-icon fjord-link">Fjord Audio</a> is my tiny audio equipment company.

You can find my short monthly [newsletter here]({% link pages/observations/subscribe.md %}), <a href="https://instagram.com/{{ site.instagram }}">Instagram here</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}">Twitter here</a>.

Thank you ☺&#xFE0E;
