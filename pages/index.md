Hi! I play drums and [make records]({% link pages/releases.html %}) in Chicago.

My dad’s new album, <a href="https://jefftweedy.bandcamp.com/album/love-is-the-king"><em>Love Is The King</em></a>, is out now.

I co-created a book, <a href="https://mirrorsoundbook.com/" style="color: hsl(295, 59%, 60%);"><em>Mirror Sound</em></a>, about musicians who self-record. It’s out now, too.

I have two EPs of my own: <a href="https://spencertweedy.bandcamp.com/album/sleep-is-my-god" style="color: #E0A336;"><em>Sleep Is My God</em></a> and <a href="https://spencertweedy.bandcamp.com/album/geezer-love" style="color: #1E4C62;"><em>Geezer Love</em></a>.

Since March 2020, my family has livestreamed regularly on our show, <a href="https://thetweedyshow.com/" style="color: rgb(75,173,233);">The Tweedy Show</a>.

I write a daily list blog called <a href="{% link pages/observations/index.html %}" class="with-icon observations-link">Observations</a>. I also run <a href="https://fjordaudio.com/" class="with-icon fjord-link">Fjord Audio</a>, a tiny audio equipment company. (The company is tiny, not the equipment.)

You can subscribe to my monthly [Observations newsletter here]({% link pages/observations/subscribe.md %}) if you want to keep up with what I’m up to.

Thank you ☺&#xFE0E;  
Spencer
