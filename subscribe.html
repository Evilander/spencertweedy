<p>At the beginning of every month, I put together my favorite observation excerpts from the previous month and send them in a short email (under 1,000 words) with no links. It's meant to be a distilled version of the site that takes up little of your time and doesn't send you down any internet rabbit holes. (The great Kottke, Kleon, and whatever other newsletters already have that covered!)</p>
<p>Also, I think it goes without saying, but I won't share your email address with anyone else.</p>
